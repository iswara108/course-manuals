      <h3>I</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        In this Kali Yuga (iron age) Japa alone is the easy way to the
        realisation of God. The famous author of a commentary on the Gita and
        of the Advaita Siddhi, Swami Madhusudana Saraswati, had direct Darsan
        of Lord Krishna through Japa of the Mantra of Lord Krishna. The
        reputed Swami Vidyaranya, the author of the Panchadasi had direct
        Darsan of Mother Gayatri through Japa of Gayatri Mantra.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        At the present moment many educated persons and college-students have
        lost faith in the power of Mantra, owing to the morbid influence of
        the study of science. They have entirely given up Japa. It is highly
        deplorable indeed. When the blood is warm they become hot-headed,
        proud and atheistic. Their brains and minds need a thorough
        overhauling and drastic flushing.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Life is short. Time is fleeting. The world is full of miseries. Cut
        the knot of Avidya, and drink the Nirvanic Bliss. That day on which
        you do not perform any Japa is simply wasted. Those who simply eat,
        drink and sleep and do not practise any Japa are horizontal beings
        only.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        A Mantra, in the Hindu religion, has a Rishi who gave it to the world;
        a metre which governs the inflection of the voice; and a Devata or a
        supernatural being, higher or lower, as its informing power. The Bija,
        seed , is a significant word, or series of words, which gives it a
        special power. Sometimes this word is a sound which harmonises with
        the key-note of the individual using it and varies it with
        individuals; sometimes this word expresses the essence of the Mantra,
        and the result of the Mantra is the flower springing from this seed.
        The Sakti is the energy of the form of the Mantra, i.e., the
        vibration-forms set up by its sounds. These carry the man to the
        Devata that is worshipped. The Kilaka, the pillar, is that which
        supports and makes strong the Mantra, or the pin which fastens the
        Mantra together; this is the ceasing of sorrow, by the freeing of
        oneself from imperfections.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Do not bother yourself about Matra, Para and Pasyanti , etc. Do Japa
        of your Ishta Mantra mentally with its meaning and right Bhava. You
        will realise the spiritual benefits. Why do you waste your time
        counting the pebbles on the bank? Take a dip immediately in the Ganges
        and enjoy the bath. Become wise.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        All Mantras have equal potency or power. It is incorrect to say that
        Om Namo Narayanaya is superior to Om Namah Sivaya or Radhesyam or Sri
        Ram, and so on. You can attain God-realisation by doing Japa of any
        Mantra. Valmiki attained God-consciousness by repeating even
        Mara-Mara. Some people Â·think that Om or Soham is superior to Om Namo
        Narayanaya, or vice versa. This also is wrong. The state gained by
        doing Japa of Om or Soham can be attained by doing Japa of Sri Ram or
        Radhesyam also.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You should not doubt the teachings of the scriptures. Flickering faith
        will lead to downfall. A man of weak will, who has no faith in Japa,
        cannot expect to have progress in the spiritual path. If he says, "I
        am practising 'who am I' enquiry"-this is all wild imagination. Few
        are fit for "who am I" enquiry.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You must have the Bhava that Atman, Isvara, Devata, Mantra are one.
        With this Bhava you will have to repeat your Guru Mantra or Ishta
        Mantra. Then alone you will have Mantra Siddhi or God-realisation
        quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The Japa of a Mantra can bring to the practitioner realisation of his
        highest goal though he may not possess knowledge of the meaning of the
        Mantra. Such a mechanical Japa may take a little more time in
        realisation than when it is practised with a knowledge of the meaning.
        There is an indescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the Mantras. If
        you repeat the Mantra with concentration on its meaning, you will
        attain God-consciousness quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Form a strong habit of repeating the Name of the Lord. Then only it
        will be easy for you to remember Him at the time of death.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        To define God is to deny God. You can give the definition of a finite
        object. How can you define limitless or the Infinite Being who is the
        source and ultimate cause for everything? If you define God you are
        limiting the limitless one, you are confining (28) Him with concepts
        of mind. God is beyond the reach of the gross mind, but He can be
        realised through Japa and meditation with a pure, subtle and
        one-pointed mind.
      </p>
      <h3>II</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Manasika Puja (mental worship) is more powerful than external Puja
        with flowers, etc. Arjuna thought that Bhima was not doing any kind of
        worship. He was proud of his external worship of Lord Siva. He offered
        plenty of Bael leaves. But Bhima offered to the Lord mentally the
        Baelleaves of all the Bael trees of the whole world. He was doing
        Manasika Puja of Lord Siva. The attendants of Lord Siva were not able
        to remove from the head of Lord Siva the Bael leaves offered by Bhima.
        Arjuna once saw a large band of people carrying baskets of Bael
        leaves. He thought within himself that the leaves must be those
        offered by him to Lord Siva and questioned them thus: "Brothers, from
        where do you carry these Baelleaves?" They replied: "0 Arjuna, these
        leaves are offered to our Lord Siva by Bhima through Manasika Puja."
        Arjuna was struck with wonder. He came to know that Manasika Puja was
        more powerful than external worship and that Bhima was a better
        devotee than he.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Manasika Puja can be done by advanced students. Beginners should
        certainly do worship with flowers, sandal paste, incense, etc. You
        will have more concentration when you do Manasika Puja. Mentally
        enthrone the Lord in Simhasana set with diamonds, pearls, emeralds,
        etc. Offer Him a seat. Apply sandal paste to His forehead and body.
        Offer Arghya, Madhuparka and various sorts of flowers, clothes, etc.
        Burn incense. Wave lights. Burn camphor. Offer various kinds of
        fruits, sweetmeats and Maha Naivedya. Offer to the Lord the fruits of
        the whole world. Do not be miserly even in Manasika Puja. In Manasika
        Puja one man offered only one stale plantain fruit and a handful of
        gram. A miserable miserly man! Even in Manasika Puja he cannot be very
        generous and liberal! This world abounds with such deplorable misers!
        In the end mentally repeat: "Kayena vacha manasendriyairva
        buddhyatmana va prakritessvabhavat, karomi yadyat sakalam parasmai
        narayanayeti samarpayami-whatever action I do by the body, by the
        speech, by the mind, by the senses, by the intellect or by my own
        nature, I offer all of them to the supreme Lord (29) Narayana." Also
        say in the end, "Om Tat Sat Brahmarpanamastu." This will purify your
        heart and remove the taint of expectation of reward.
      </p>
      <h3>III</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Without love man's life is empty. Without love man lives in vain. Love
        is vital. It is all-pervading. Love is a greater power. Love is the
        sap of life. Give love. Cultivate this love through servioo, Japa,
        Satsanga and meditation.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        God is always with you. He will protect and deliver you. Take refuge
        in Him. His blessings overflow into your life and transform your mind
        and body. Develop your consciousness of spiritual things. Make a
        special effort daily to exercise control over your thoughts, words and
        actions. Feel His presence in your room. Pray and meditate daily.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Prayer elevates the mind. It fills the mind with purity. It is
        associated with praise of God. It keeps the mind in tune with God.
        Prayer can reach a realm where reason does not dare to enter. Prayer
        can move mountains. It can work miracles. It frees the devotee from
        the fear of death. It brings him nearer to God and makes him feel the
        divine consciousness and his essential, immortal and blissful nature.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Surrender everything to Him. Place your ego at His feet and be at
        ease. He will take complete charge of you. Let Him mould you in any
        way He likes. Let Him do exactly as He wills. He will remove all
        defects and weaknesses. He will play beautifully on this body-flute.
        Hear this marvellous music of His flute, the mysterious music of the
        Soul, and rejoice.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Make your offerings to the Lord with the same mental attitude as that
        of Bhilini Sabari. Call the Lord with the same Bhava of Draupadi or
        with the Bhava which Gajendra had when he called Lord Hari. You will
        surely meet your Beloved. Develop this Bhava. You will have the Darsan
        of the Lord immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Feel His Presence everywhere. Strive ceaselessly to fix your mind on
        the Lord. Try to constantly behold your Beloved in all these forms.
        Silently repeat His Names. Sometimes sing His Names. Silently do
        Kirtan. Melt the mind in Him. Rejoice in silence in Him.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        If you get up at Brahmamuhurta, at 4 a.m., you will have a clear mind.
        There is a spiritual influence and mysterious silence in the early
        morning hours. All saints and Yogis practise meditation at this period
        and send their spiritual vibrations to the whole world. You will be
        highly benefited by their vibrations if you start your prayer, Japa
        and meditation at this period. You need not exert much. The meditative
        state of mind will come by itself.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Gaze at the picture of the Lord, your Ishta-Oevata, for a few minutes,
        and close your eyes. Then try to visualise the picture mentally. You
        will have a well-defined or clear-cut picture of the Lord. When it
        fades, open your eyes and gaze. Repeat the process 5 or 6 times. You
        will be able to visualise clearly your Ishta-Devata or tutelary deity
        mentally, after some months' practice.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        If you find it difficult to visualise the whole picture, try to
        visualise any part of the picture. Try to produce at least a hazy
        picture. By repeated practice the hazy picture will assume a
        well-defined, clear-cut form. If you find this to be difficult, fix
        the mind on the effulgent light in the heart and take this as the form
        of the Lord or your Ishta.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The thoughts you create in your mind and the images you form in your
        daily life help you in making what you are or what you would become.
        If you constantly think of Lord Krishna, you will become identical
        with the Lord. You will abide in Him for ever. You will become one
        with the Deity you meditate upon.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        In Bhava-Samadhi the mind of the devotee is highly elevated through
        pure emotion and devotion. He forgets the body and the world. His mind
        is wholly absorbed in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Contentment, unruffled state of the mind, cheerfulness, patience,
        decrease in excretions, sweet voice, eagerness and steadiness in the
        practice of meditation, disgust for worldly prosperity and success and
        company, desire to remain alone in a quiet room or in seclusion,
        desire for association with Sadhus and Sannyasins, Ekagrata or
        one-pointedness of mind, are some of the signs that indicate that you
        are growing in purity, that you are progressing in the spiritual path.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        When you enter the silence through deep meditation the world outside
        and all your troubles will drop away. You will enjoy supreme peace. In
        the silence is the Supreme Light of lights. In the silence is
        undecaying bliss. In this silence is real strength and perennial joy.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Shut out the doors of the senses. Still the thoughts, emotions and
        feelings. Sit motionless and calm in the early morning hours. Ignore
        the visions and coloured lights. Have a receptive attitude. Go alone
        with God. Commune with Him. Enjoy the abiding peace in silence.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        In the Srimad Bhagavata the Lord Sri Krishna says to Uddhava, "I am
        not so easily attainable by Yoga, Sankhya or discrimination, Dharma,
        study of the Vedas, Tapas, renunciation, liberal gifts, charitable
        acts, rites such as Agnihotra, fasts, vows, secret Mantras, resort to
        pilgrimages, Yamas, Niyamas (moral rules), as by Satsanga (company of
        Sadhus or the wise) which puts an end to all attachments. It is only
        by association with the wise and the righteous, that many who were of
        Rajasic or Tamasic nature-such as Vritra, son of the sage Tvashtri ;
        Prahlada, the Daityas, the Asuras and the Rakshasas, Gandharvas,
        Apsaras, Nagas, Siddhas, Charanas, Guhyakas and Vidyadharas, many
        beasts and birds, and among mankind Vaisyas, Sudras, women and
        outcastes who are of the lowest birth, have attained Me. Vrishaparva,
        Bali, Bana, Maya, Vibhishana, Sugriva, Hanuman; Jambavan, the bear;
        Gajendra, the elephant; Jatayu, the vulture; Tuladhara, the merchant;
        Dharmavyadha, the fowler; Kubja, the hunch-backed perfume-seiler; the
        Gopis 'in Vraja, the wives of the Brahmanas engaged in sacrifices in
        Brindavana, and others-all these did not study the Vedas, did not sit
        at the feet of great men of learning for the sake of knowledge. They
        did not observe any vows or fasts. They did not perform Tapas but they
        attained Me through association with saints and Sadhus. Through love
        alone, developed through the company of saints, the Gopis and even the
        cows, trees, beasts, serpents and others of dull-witted nature, became
        perfected and easily attained Me whom one does not attain by making
        great endeavours through Yoga or Sankhya, charity, vows, Tapas,
        sacrifices, teaching and study of the Vedas or renunciation.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Satsanga or association with the sages removes the darkness of the
        heart. It is a safe boat to cross the ocean of Samsara. Satsanga
        elevates the mind and fills it with Sattva or purity. It eradicates
        vicious thoughts and impressions in the heart. It leads one to the
        right path and causes the Sun of Wisdom to shine upon one's mind.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You may do Japa of 'Om Namah Sivaya' Mantra, if you are a votary of
        Lord Siva, or 'Om Namo Narayanaya' if you are a devotee of Lord
        Vishnu. These are very powerful Mantras. None can explain the benefits
        of Japa, Sadhana and Satsanga. Japa is the rod in the hands of the
        blind Sadhakas to plod on the road to realisation. Japa is the
        philosopher's stone or divine elixir that makes one God-like. Through
        Japa alone one can realise God in this life.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        This book will throw much light on the important subject of Mantra
        Yoga and the method of attaining perfection through Japa. The First
        Chapter gives the definition of Japa. The Second Chapter deals with
        the glory and importance of the Name of God. Different kinds of
        Mantras are given in the Third Chapter. The Fourth Chapter contains
        many practical and useful instructions on Sadhana. The Fifth Chapter
        gives a short sketch of the lives of some of the saints who realised
        God through Japa.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        May God give you inner strength to control the Indriyas and the mind
        and to practise Japa Yoga and worship uninterruptedly! May you have
        unshakable faith in the miraculous powers and marvellous benefits of
        Japa Yoga! May you all realise the glory of Nama, the Name of God! May
        you all spread the glory of Nama throughout the length and breadth of
        the land! Victory to Hari and His Name! Glory to Hari and His Name!
        May the blessings of Lord Siva, Hari, Rama and Krishna be upon you
        all!

      <h2 class="lesson-header">Lesson 2 - Hints on Japa Yoga Sadhana</h2>
      <ol class="lesson-text">
        <li>Man cannot live by bread alone; but he can live repeating the Name of the Lord alone.</li>
        <li>A Yogi crosses the ocean of Samsara by his
          Chittavritti-Nirodha, controlling the modifications that arise in
          the mind; a Jnani by his Brahmakara-VriUi (by raising the pure
          thought of Infinity); and a Bhakta by doing Nama-Smarana. The
          Name of the Lord has a very great power. It gives eternal bliss.
          It bestows immortality (Amritatva). Through its power you can
          have direct vision of the Lord. It brings you face to face with the
          Supreme Being and makes you realise your oneness with the
          Infinite and the whole world at large. What a wonderful, magnetic, electrifying influence the Name of the
          Lord
          possesses!
          Feel it, my dear friends, by chanting His Name and rolling the
          beads. One who does not do Smarana of Hari is a Neecha
          (low-born). The day spent without the remembrance of His
          Name is a mere waste.</li>
        <li>It was by the glory of Rama-Nama that the stones
          floated in water, and the bridge, the Sethu over the sea, was
          built by Sugriva and his companions, at Ramesvara. It was
          Hari-Nama that cooled Prahlada, when he was thrown into a
          conflagration of fire.</li>
        <li>Any Nama of the Lord is nectar. It is sweeter than
          sugar-candy. It gives immortality to the Jivas. It is the essence
          of the Vedas. Amrita came out, in days of yore, during the process of the churning of the ocean by the Devas
          and
          the Asuras.
          By churning the four Vedas, the Name of Rama, the nectar, was
          brought out to quench the three kinds of Taapas of the ignorant
          Jivas. Drink it again and again by constant repetition, just as
          Valmiki did in days long gone by.</li>
        <li>That bungalow or palace or a place in which or where
          no Hari-Sankirtana or worship is done is only a burial ground,
          even though it is furnished with sofas, electric lights and electric fans, fine gardens, and such other
          things.
        </li>
        <li>Renounce everything. Live on alms. Live in seclusion. Repeat 'Om Namo Narayanaya' fourteen crore times.
          This can be done within four years. Do one lakh times Japa
          daily. You can see Hari face to face. Can you not undergo a little
          suffering for a short period when you can thereby get the fruit of
          immortality, infinite peace and eternal happiness?</li>
        <li>Japa is a very great purifier. It checks the force of the
          thought-current moving towards objects. It forces the mind to
          move towards God, towards the attainment of eternal bliss.</li>
        <li>Japa eventually helps in obtaining Darsana of God.
          The Mantra-Chaitanya is hidden in every Mantra.</li>
        <li>Japa reinforces the Sadhana-Sakti of the Sadhaka. It
          makes him morally and spiritually strong.</li>
        <li>The vibration produced by the chanting of a Mantra
          corresponds to the original vibration that arose from
          Hiranyagarbha.</li>
        <li>The rhythmical vlbration produced through Japa regulates the unsteady vibrations of the five sheaths.</li>
        <li>Japa changes the mind-stuff from worldliness to spirituality, from Rajas and activity to Sattva and
          illumination.</li>
        <li>The Name of the Lord is an inexhaustible storehouse
          of spiritual knowledge.</li>
        <li>Even mechanical repetition of a Mantra plays a great
          part in the evolution of the soul. Even a simple parrot-like
          gramophonic repetition of a Mantra, too, is beneficial. It has got
          its own effect.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Practice of the Divine Name</h3>
      <ol start="15" class="lesson-text">
        <li>In the Satya-Yuga meditation has been prescribed as
          the principal form of discipline, as the minds of men were generally pure and free from distractions.</li>
        <li>In the Treta-Yuga sacrifices were prescribed, as materials for the performance of Yajna were easily
          procurable
          then, and as people were slightly Rajasic.</li>
        <li>In the Dvapara-Yuga worship was recommended as
          the principal form of Sadhana, as there was greater facility for
          direct worship of God, and as there was a greater manifestation
          of the sportive energy of God.</li>
        <li>In the Kali-Yuga, as the mind of men are naturally
          prone to greater distractions, meditation, worship and performance of sacrifices are not possible.
          Therefore,
          loud chanting
          of the Divine Name or Kirtan or Namasmarana (remembrance
          of the Lord's Name) has been recommended as the principal
          Sadhana for God-realisation.</li>
        <li>God's Name is your boat, Sankirtan is your raft. Cross
          this ocean of Sam sara with this boat and raft.</li>
        <li>No one obtains liberation without the Name of the
          Lord. Your highest duty is to repeat His Name always. Name is
          the greatest Treasure of treasures.</li>
        <li>Rama-Nama is the true substance of the four Vedas.
          He who repeats 'Rama, Rama', pouring out tears of love, attains life eternal and everlasting bliss. The Name
          'Rama' will
          guide him on the path. Therefore, say 'Rama, Rama'.</li>
        <li>He who recites Sri Rama's Name can never come to
          grief. Lord Rama is the bestower of blessedness. He has the
          power to liberate people from the unceasing round of births and
          deaths.</li>
        <li>The Name of Hari is, undoubtedly, the surest, safest
          and the easiest means of expiating sins. This is a well-known
          fact.</li>
        <li>The Name of the Lord is the unfailing source of
          strength. In the darkest hour of your trial, only God's Name will
          save you.</li>
        <li>Prahlada, Dhruva and Sanaka realised God through
          Namasmarana or remembrance of the Lord's Name.</li>
        <li>The greatest of sinners can attain God-realisation
          through the blessings of the Name.</li>
        <li>Meditate on God's Name with the belief that the
          Name and Named (God) are identical.</li>
        <li>Japa or recitation of the Lord's Name purges the mind
          of all impurities and fills it with bliss. It attunes the soul with God
          and fills it with His presence. It brings about perfect communion
          of the soul with God.</li>
        <li>Take refuge in the Lord with all your being, and chant
          His Name with devotion. This is the final verdict of the Sastras
          and the considerate opinion of the saints.</li>
        <li>Chanting of the Lord's Name brightens the mirror of
          mind, burns the forest of desires and bathes the whole being in
          a flood of joy.</li>
        <li>Resist temptation by taking refuge in the Name of the
          Lord. Have love for solitude and silence. Have the inward life.
          All miseries will terminate. You will enjoy supreme felicity.</li>
        <li>Strike the chords in your heart by chanting Om, by doing Japa of Om Namah Sivaya, by singing Hare Rama,
          Hare
          Krishna; and hear the thrilling, eternal superb music of the
          Soul.</li>
        <li>Repeat constantly 'Om Nama Bhagavate
          Vaasudevaya', the Dvadasa-Akshara or the twelve-lettered
          Mantra of Sri Krishna, the joy of Gokula, the delight of Sri
          Radha, the darling of Nanda, and obtain His grace and
          Darsana.</li>
        <li>God is the one Doctor for all sicknesses. Rely on Him
          alone. The Names of God are the most potent, unfailing tonics,
          sure panaceas, well-tried elixirs, sovereign specifics.</li>
        <li>My rosary is my tongue, on which I repeat God's
          Name. </li>
