        <p class="lesson-text">
          In this Kali Yuga (iron age) Japa alone is the easy way to the
          realisation of God. The famous author of a commentary on the Gita and
          of the Advaita Siddhi, Swami Madhusudana Saraswati, had direct Darsan
          of Lord Krishna through Japa of the Mantra of Lord Krishna. The
          reputed Swami Vidyaranya, the author of the Panchadasi had direct
          Darsan of Mother Gayatri through Japa of Gayatri Mantra.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          At the present moment many educated persons and college-students have
          lost faith in the power of Mantra, owing to the morbid influence of
          the study of science. They have entirely given up Japa. It is highly
          deplorable indeed. When the blood is warm they become hot-headed,
          proud and atheistic. Their brains and minds need a thorough
          overhauling and drastic flushing.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Life is short. Time is fleeting. The world is full of miseries. Cut
          the knot of Avidya, and drink the Nirvanic Bliss. That day on which
          you do not perform any Japa is simply wasted. Those who simply eat,
          drink and sleep and do not practise any Japa are horizontal beings
          only.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          A Mantra, in the Hindu religion, has a Rishi who gave it to the world;
          a metre which governs the inflection of the voice; and a Devata or a
          supernatural being, higher or lower, as its informing power. The Bija,
          seed , is a significant word, or series of words, which gives it a
          special power. Sometimes this word is a sound which harmonises with
          the key-note of the individual using it and varies it with
          individuals; sometimes this word expresses the essence of the Mantra,
          and the result of the Mantra is the flower springing from this seed.
          The Sakti is the energy of the form of the Mantra, i.e., the
          vibration-forms set up by its sounds. These carry the man to the
          Devata that is worshipped. The Kilaka, the pillar, is that which
          supports and makes strong the Mantra, or the pin which fastens the
          Mantra together; this is the ceasing of sorrow, by the freeing of
          oneself from imperfections.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Do not bother yourself about Matra, Para and Pasyanti , etc. Do Japa
          of your Ishta Mantra mentally with its meaning and right Bhava. You
          will realise the spiritual benefits. Why do you waste your time
          counting the pebbles on the bank? Take a dip immediately in the Ganges
          and enjoy the bath. Become wise.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          All Mantras have equal potency or power. It is incorrect to say that
          Om Namo Narayanaya is superior to Om Namah Sivaya or Radhesyam or Sri
          Ram, and so on. You can attain God-realisation by doing Japa of any
          Mantra. Valmiki attained God-consciousness by repeating even
          Mara-Mara. Some people Â·think that Om or Soham is superior to Om Namo
          Narayanaya, or vice versa. This also is wrong. The state gained by
          doing Japa of Om or Soham can be attained by doing Japa of Sri Ram or
          Radhesyam also.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          You should not doubt the teachings of the scriptures. Flickering faith
          will lead to downfall. A man of weak will, who has no faith in Japa,
          cannot expect to have progress in the spiritual path. If he says, "I
          am practising 'who am I' enquiry"-this is all wild imagination. Few
          are fit for "who am I" enquiry.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          You must have the Bhava that Atman, Isvara, Devata, Mantra are one.
          With this Bhava you will have to repeat your Guru Mantra or Ishta
          Mantra. Then alone you will have Mantra Siddhi or God-realisation
          quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The Japa of a Mantra can bring to the practitioner realisation of his
          highest goal though he may not possess knowledge of the meaning of the
          Mantra. Such a mechanical Japa may take a little more time in
          realisation than when it is practised with a knowledge of the meaning.
          There is an indescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the Mantras. If
          you repeat the Mantra with concentration on its meaning, you will
          attain God-consciousness quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Form a strong habit of repeating the Name of the Lord. Then only it
          will be easy for you to remember Him at the time of death.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          To define God is to deny God. You can give the definition of a finite
          object. How can you define limitless or the Infinite Being who is the
          source and ultimate cause for everything? If you define God you are
          limiting the limitless one, you are confining (28) Him with concepts
          of mind. God is beyond the reach of the gross mind, but He can be
          realised through Japa and meditation with a pure, subtle and
          one-pointed mind.
        </p>
        <h3>II</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Manasika Puja (mental worship) is more powerful than external Puja
          with flowers, etc. Arjuna thought that Bhima was not doing any kind of
          worship. He was proud of his external worship of Lord Siva. He offered
          plenty of Bael leaves. But Bhima offered to the Lord mentally the
          Baelleaves of all the Bael trees of the whole world. He was doing
          Manasika Puja of Lord Siva. The attendants of Lord Siva were not able
          to remove from the head of Lord Siva the Bael leaves offered by Bhima.
          Arjuna once saw a large band of people carrying baskets of Bael
          leaves. He thought within himself that the leaves must be those
          offered by him to Lord Siva and questioned them thus: "Brothers, from
          where do you carry these Baelleaves?" They replied: "0 Arjuna, these
          leaves are offered to our Lord Siva by Bhima through Manasika Puja."
          Arjuna was struck with wonder. He came to know that Manasika Puja was
          more powerful than external worship and that Bhima was a better
          devotee than he.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Manasika Puja can be done by advanced students. Beginners should
          certainly do worship with flowers, sandal paste, incense, etc. You
          will have more concentration when you do Manasika Puja. Mentally
          enthrone the Lord in Simhasana set with diamonds, pearls, emeralds,
          etc. Offer Him a seat. Apply sandal paste to His forehead and body.
          Offer Arghya, Madhuparka and various sorts of flowers, clothes, etc.
          Burn incense. Wave lights. Burn camphor. Offer various kinds of
          fruits, sweetmeats and Maha Naivedya. Offer to the Lord the fruits of
          the whole world. Do not be miserly even in Manasika Puja. In Manasika
          Puja one man offered only one stale plantain fruit and a handful of
          gram. A miserable miserly man! Even in Manasika Puja he cannot be very
          generous and liberal! This world abounds with such deplorable misers!
          In the end mentally repeat: "Kayena vacha manasendriyairva
          buddhyatmana va prakritessvabhavat, karomi yadyat sakalam parasmai
          narayanayeti samarpayami-whatever action I do by the body, by the
          speech, by the mind, by the senses, by the intellect or by my own
          nature, I offer all of them to the supreme Lord (29) Narayana." Also
          say in the end, "Om Tat Sat Brahmarpanamastu." This will purify your
          heart and remove the taint of expectation of reward.
        </p>
        <h3>III</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Without love man's life is empty. Without love man lives in vain. Love
          is vital. It is all-pervading. Love is a greater power. Love is the
          sap of life. Give love. Cultivate this love through servioo, Japa,
          Satsanga and meditation.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          God is always with you. He will protect and deliver you. Take refuge
          in Him. His blessings overflow into your life and transform your mind
          and body. Develop your consciousness of spiritual things. Make a
          special effort daily to exercise control over your thoughts, words and
          actions. Feel His presence in your room. Pray and meditate daily.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Prayer elevates the mind. It fills the mind with purity. It is
          associated with praise of God. It keeps the mind in tune with God.
          Prayer can reach a realm where reason does not dare to enter. Prayer
          can move mountains. It can work miracles. It frees the devotee from
          the fear of death. It brings him nearer to God and makes him feel the
          divine consciousness and his essential, immortal and blissful nature.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Surrender everything to Him. Place your ego at His feet and be at
          ease. He will take complete charge of you. Let Him mould you in any
          way He likes. Let Him do exactly as He wills. He will remove all
          defects and weaknesses. He will play beautifully on this body-flute.
          Hear this marvellous music of His flute, the mysterious music of the
          Soul, and rejoice.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Make your offerings to the Lord with the same mental attitude as that
          of Bhilini Sabari. Call the Lord with the same Bhava of Draupadi or
          with the Bhava which Gajendra had when he called Lord Hari. You will
          surely meet your Beloved. Develop this Bhava. You will have the Darsan
          of the Lord immediately.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Feel His Presence everywhere. Strive ceaselessly to fix your mind on
          the Lord. Try to constantly behold your Beloved in all these forms.
          Silently repeat His Names. Sometimes sing His Names. Silently do
          Kirtan. Melt the mind in Him. Rejoice in silence in Him.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          If you get up at Brahmamuhurta, at 4 a.m., you will have a clear mind.
          There is a spiritual influence and mysterious silence in the early
          morning hours. All saints and Yogis practise meditation at this period
          and send their spiritual vibrations to the whole world. You will be
          highly benefited by their vibrations if you start your prayer, Japa
          and meditation at this period. You need not exert much. The meditative
          state of mind will come by itself.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Gaze at the picture of the Lord, your Ishta-Oevata, for a few minutes,
          and close your eyes. Then try to visualise the picture mentally. You
          will have a well-defined or clear-cut picture of the Lord. When it
          fades, open your eyes and gaze. Repeat the process 5 or 6 times. You
          will be able to visualise clearly your Ishta-Devata or tutelary deity
          mentally, after some months' practice.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          If you find it difficult to visualise the whole picture, try to
          visualise any part of the picture. Try to produce at least a hazy
          picture. By repeated practice the hazy picture will assume a
          well-defined, clear-cut form. If you find this to be difficult, fix
          the mind on the effulgent light in the heart and take this as the form
          of the Lord or your Ishta.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The thoughts you create in your mind and the images you form in your
          daily life help you in making what you are or what you would become.
          If you constantly think of Lord Krishna, you will become identical
          with the Lord. You will abide in Him for ever. You will become one
          with the Deity you meditate upon.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          In Bhava-Samadhi the mind of the devotee is highly elevated through
          pure emotion and devotion. He forgets the body and the world. His mind
          is wholly absorbed in the Lord.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Contentment, unruffled state of the mind, cheerfulness, patience,
          decrease in excretions, sweet voice, eagerness and steadiness in the
          practice of meditation, disgust for worldly prosperity and success and
          company, desire to remain alone in a quiet room or in seclusion,
          desire for association with Sadhus and Sannyasins, Ekagrata or
          one-pointedness of mind, are some of the signs that indicate that you
          are growing in purity, that you are progressing in the spiritual path.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          When you enter the silence through deep meditation the world outside
          and all your troubles will drop away. You will enjoy supreme peace. In
          the silence is the Supreme Light of lights. In the silence is
          undecaying bliss. In this silence is real strength and perennial joy.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Shut out the doors of the senses. Still the thoughts, emotions and
          feelings. Sit motionless and calm in the early morning hours. Ignore
          the visions and coloured lights. Have a receptive attitude. Go alone
          with God. Commune with Him. Enjoy the abiding peace in silence.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          In the Srimad Bhagavata the Lord Sri Krishna says to Uddhava, "I am
          not so easily attainable by Yoga, Sankhya or discrimination, Dharma,
          study of the Vedas, Tapas, renunciation, liberal gifts, charitable
          acts, rites such as Agnihotra, fasts, vows, secret Mantras, resort to
          pilgrimages, Yamas, Niyamas (moral rules), as by Satsanga (company of
          Sadhus or the wise) which puts an end to all attachments. It is only
          by association with the wise and the righteous, that many who were of
          Rajasic or Tamasic nature-such as Vritra, son of the sage Tvashtri ;
          Prahlada, the Daityas, the Asuras and the Rakshasas, Gandharvas,
          Apsaras, Nagas, Siddhas, Charanas, Guhyakas and Vidyadharas, many
          beasts and birds, and among mankind Vaisyas, Sudras, women and
          outcastes who are of the lowest birth, have attained Me. Vrishaparva,
          Bali, Bana, Maya, Vibhishana, Sugriva, Hanuman; Jambavan, the bear;
          Gajendra, the elephant; Jatayu, the vulture; Tuladhara, the merchant;
          Dharmavyadha, the fowler; Kubja, the hunch-backed perfume-seiler; the
          Gopis 'in Vraja, the wives of the Brahmanas engaged in sacrifices in
          Brindavana, and others-all these did not study the Vedas, did not sit
          at the feet of great men of learning for the sake of knowledge. They
          did not observe any vows or fasts. They did not perform Tapas but they
          attained Me through association with saints and Sadhus. Through love
          alone, developed through the company of saints, the Gopis and even the
          cows, trees, beasts, serpents and others of dull-witted nature, became
          perfected and easily attained Me whom one does not attain by making
          great endeavours through Yoga or Sankhya, charity, vows, Tapas,
          sacrifices, teaching and study of the Vedas or renunciation.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Satsanga or association with the sages removes the darkness of the
          heart. It is a safe boat to cross the ocean of Samsara. Satsanga
          elevates the mind and fills it with Sattva or purity. It eradicates
          vicious thoughts and impressions in the heart. It leads one to the
          right path and causes the Sun of Wisdom to shine upon one's mind.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          You may do Japa of 'Om Namah Sivaya' Mantra, if you are a votary of
          Lord Siva, or 'Om Namo Narayanaya' if you are a devotee of Lord
          Vishnu. These are very powerful Mantras. None can explain the benefits
          of Japa, Sadhana and Satsanga. Japa is the rod in the hands of the
          blind Sadhakas to plod on the road to realisation. Japa is the
          philosopher's stone or divine elixir that makes one God-like. Through
          Japa alone one can realise God in this life.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          This book will throw much light on the important subject of Mantra
          Yoga and the method of attaining perfection through Japa. The First
          Chapter gives the definition of Japa. The Second Chapter deals with
          the glory and importance of the Name of God. Different kinds of
          Mantras are given in the Third Chapter. The Fourth Chapter contains
          many practical and useful instructions on Sadhana. The Fifth Chapter
          gives a short sketch of the lives of some of the saints who realised
          God through Japa.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          May God give you inner strength to control the Indriyas and the mind
          and to practise Japa Yoga and worship uninterruptedly! May you have
          unshakable faith in the miraculous powers and marvellous benefits of
          Japa Yoga! May you all realise the glory of Nama, the Name of God! May
          you all spread the glory of Nama throughout the length and breadth of
          the land! Victory to Hari and His Name! Glory to Hari and His Name!
          May the blessings of Lord Siva, Hari, Rama and Krishna be upon you
          all!
