      <h3>I</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        In this Kali Yuga (iron age) Japa alone is the easy way to the
        realisation of God. The famous author of a commentary on the Gita and
        of the Advaita Siddhi, Swami Madhusudana Saraswati, had direct Darsan
        of Lord Krishna through Japa of the Mantra of Lord Krishna. The
        reputed Swami Vidyaranya, the author of the Panchadasi had direct
        Darsan of Mother Gayatri through Japa of Gayatri Mantra.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        At the present moment many educated persons and college-students have
        lost faith in the power of Mantra, owing to the morbid influence of
        the study of science. They have entirely given up Japa. It is highly
        deplorable indeed. When the blood is warm they become hot-headed,
        proud and atheistic. Their brains and minds need a thorough
        overhauling and drastic flushing.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Life is short. Time is fleeting. The world is full of miseries. Cut
        the knot of Avidya, and drink the Nirvanic Bliss. That day on which
        you do not perform any Japa is simply wasted. Those who simply eat,
        drink and sleep and do not practise any Japa are horizontal beings
        only.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        A Mantra, in the Hindu religion, has a Rishi who gave it to the world;
        a metre which governs the inflection of the voice; and a Devata or a
        supernatural being, higher or lower, as its informing power. The Bija,
        seed , is a significant word, or series of words, which gives it a
        special power. Sometimes this word is a sound which harmonises with
        the key-note of the individual using it and varies it with
        individuals; sometimes this word expresses the essence of the Mantra,
        and the result of the Mantra is the flower springing from this seed.
        The Sakti is the energy of the form of the Mantra, i.e., the
        vibration-forms set up by its sounds. These carry the man to the
        Devata that is worshipped. The Kilaka, the pillar, is that which
        supports and makes strong the Mantra, or the pin which fastens the
        Mantra together; this is the ceasing of sorrow, by the freeing of
        oneself from imperfections.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Do not bother yourself about Matra, Para and Pasyanti , etc. Do Japa
        of your Ishta Mantra mentally with its meaning and right Bhava. You
        will realise the spiritual benefits. Why do you waste your time
        counting the pebbles on the bank? Take a dip immediately in the Ganges
        and enjoy the bath. Become wise.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        All Mantras have equal potency or power. It is incorrect to say that
        Om Namo Narayanaya is superior to Om Namah Sivaya or Radhesyam or Sri
        Ram, and so on. You can attain God-realisation by doing Japa of any
        Mantra. Valmiki attained God-consciousness by repeating even
        Mara-Mara. Some people Â·think that Om or Soham is superior to Om Namo
        Narayanaya, or vice versa. This also is wrong. The state gained by
        doing Japa of Om or Soham can be attained by doing Japa of Sri Ram or
        Radhesyam also.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You should not doubt the teachings of the scriptures. Flickering faith
        will lead to downfall. A man of weak will, who has no faith in Japa,
        cannot expect to have progress in the spiritual path. If he says, "I
        am practising 'who am I' enquiry"-this is all wild imagination. Few
        are fit for "who am I" enquiry.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You must have the Bhava that Atman, Isvara, Devata, Mantra are one.
        With this Bhava you will have to repeat your Guru Mantra or Ishta
        Mantra. Then alone you will have Mantra Siddhi or God-realisation
        quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The Japa of a Mantra can bring to the practitioner realisation of his
        highest goal though he may not possess knowledge of the meaning of the
        Mantra. Such a mechanical Japa may take a little more time in
        realisation than when it is practised with a knowledge of the meaning.
        There is an indescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the Mantras. If
        you repeat the Mantra with concentration on its meaning, you will
        attain God-consciousness quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Form a strong habit of repeating the Name of the Lord. Then only it
        will be easy for you to remember Him at the time of death.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        To define God is to deny God. You can give the definition of a finite
        object. How can you define limitless or the Infinite Being who is the
        source and ultimate cause for everything? If you define God you are
        limiting the limitless one, you are confining (28) Him with concepts
        of mind. God is beyond the reach of the gross mind, but He can be
        realised through Japa and meditation with a pure, subtle and
        one-pointed mind.
      </p>
      <h3>II</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Manasika Puja (mental worship) is more powerful than external Puja
        with flowers, etc. Arjuna thought that Bhima was not doing any kind of
        worship. He was proud of his external worship of Lord Siva. He offered
        plenty of Bael leaves. But Bhima offered to the Lord mentally the
        Baelleaves of all the Bael trees of the whole world. He was doing
        Manasika Puja of Lord Siva. The attendants of Lord Siva were not able
        to remove from the head of Lord Siva the Bael leaves offered by Bhima.
        Arjuna once saw a large band of people carrying baskets of Bael
        leaves. He thought within himself that the leaves must be those
        offered by him to Lord Siva and questioned them thus: "Brothers, from
        where do you carry these Baelleaves?" They replied: "0 Arjuna, these
        leaves are offered to our Lord Siva by Bhima through Manasika Puja."
        Arjuna was struck with wonder. He came to know that Manasika Puja was
        more powerful than external worship and that Bhima was a better
        devotee than he.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Manasika Puja can be done by advanced students. Beginners should
        certainly do worship with flowers, sandal paste, incense, etc. You
        will have more concentration when you do Manasika Puja. Mentally
        enthrone the Lord in Simhasana set with diamonds, pearls, emeralds,
        etc. Offer Him a seat. Apply sandal paste to His forehead and body.
        Offer Arghya, Madhuparka and various sorts of flowers, clothes, etc.
        Burn incense. Wave lights. Burn camphor. Offer various kinds of
        fruits, sweetmeats and Maha Naivedya. Offer to the Lord the fruits of
        the whole world. Do not be miserly even in Manasika Puja. In Manasika
        Puja one man offered only one stale plantain fruit and a handful of
        gram. A miserable miserly man! Even in Manasika Puja he cannot be very
        generous and liberal! This world abounds with such deplorable misers!
        In the end mentally repeat: "Kayena vacha manasendriyairva
        buddhyatmana va prakritessvabhavat, karomi yadyat sakalam parasmai
        narayanayeti samarpayami-whatever action I do by the body, by the
        speech, by the mind, by the senses, by the intellect or by my own
        nature, I offer all of them to the supreme Lord (29) Narayana." Also
        say in the end, "Om Tat Sat Brahmarpanamastu." This will purify your
        heart and remove the taint of expectation of reward.
      </p>
      <h3>III</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Without love man's life is empty. Without love man lives in vain. Love
        is vital. It is all-pervading. Love is a greater power. Love is the
        sap of life. Give love. Cultivate this love through servioo, Japa,
        Satsanga and meditation.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        God is always with you. He will protect and deliver you. Take refuge
        in Him. His blessings overflow into your life and transform your mind
        and body. Develop your consciousness of spiritual things. Make a
        special effort daily to exercise control over your thoughts, words and
        actions. Feel His presence in your room. Pray and meditate daily.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Prayer elevates the mind. It fills the mind with purity. It is
        associated with praise of God. It keeps the mind in tune with God.
        Prayer can reach a realm where reason does not dare to enter. Prayer
        can move mountains. It can work miracles. It frees the devotee from
        the fear of death. It brings him nearer to God and makes him feel the
        divine consciousness and his essential, immortal and blissful nature.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Surrender everything to Him. Place your ego at His feet and be at
        ease. He will take complete charge of you. Let Him mould you in any
        way He likes. Let Him do exactly as He wills. He will remove all
        defects and weaknesses. He will play beautifully on this body-flute.
        Hear this marvellous music of His flute, the mysterious music of the
        Soul, and rejoice.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Make your offerings to the Lord with the same mental attitude as that
        of Bhilini Sabari. Call the Lord with the same Bhava of Draupadi or
        with the Bhava which Gajendra had when he called Lord Hari. You will
        surely meet your Beloved. Develop this Bhava. You will have the Darsan
        of the Lord immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Feel His Presence everywhere. Strive ceaselessly to fix your mind on
        the Lord. Try to constantly behold your Beloved in all these forms.
        Silently repeat His Names. Sometimes sing His Names. Silently do
        Kirtan. Melt the mind in Him. Rejoice in silence in Him.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        If you get up at Brahmamuhurta, at 4 a.m., you will have a clear mind.
        There is a spiritual influence and mysterious silence in the early
        morning hours. All saints and Yogis practise meditation at this period
        and send their spiritual vibrations to the whole world. You will be
        highly benefited by their vibrations if you start your prayer, Japa
        and meditation at this period. You need not exert much. The meditative
        state of mind will come by itself.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Gaze at the picture of the Lord, your Ishta-Oevata, for a few minutes,
        and close your eyes. Then try to visualise the picture mentally. You
        will have a well-defined or clear-cut picture of the Lord. When it
        fades, open your eyes and gaze. Repeat the process 5 or 6 times. You
        will be able to visualise clearly your Ishta-Devata or tutelary deity
        mentally, after some months' practice.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        If you find it difficult to visualise the whole picture, try to
        visualise any part of the picture. Try to produce at least a hazy
        picture. By repeated practice the hazy picture will assume a
        well-defined, clear-cut form. If you find this to be difficult, fix
        the mind on the effulgent light in the heart and take this as the form
        of the Lord or your Ishta.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The thoughts you create in your mind and the images you form in your
        daily life help you in making what you are or what you would become.
        If you constantly think of Lord Krishna, you will become identical
        with the Lord. You will abide in Him for ever. You will become one
        with the Deity you meditate upon.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        In Bhava-Samadhi the mind of the devotee is highly elevated through
        pure emotion and devotion. He forgets the body and the world. His mind
        is wholly absorbed in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Contentment, unruffled state of the mind, cheerfulness, patience,
        decrease in excretions, sweet voice, eagerness and steadiness in the
        practice of meditation, disgust for worldly prosperity and success and
        company, desire to remain alone in a quiet room or in seclusion,
        desire for association with Sadhus and Sannyasins, Ekagrata or
        one-pointedness of mind, are some of the signs that indicate that you
        are growing in purity, that you are progressing in the spiritual path.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        When you enter the silence through deep meditation the world outside
        and all your troubles will drop away. You will enjoy supreme peace. In
        the silence is the Supreme Light of lights. In the silence is
        undecaying bliss. In this silence is real strength and perennial joy.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Shut out the doors of the senses. Still the thoughts, emotions and
        feelings. Sit motionless and calm in the early morning hours. Ignore
        the visions and coloured lights. Have a receptive attitude. Go alone
        with God. Commune with Him. Enjoy the abiding peace in silence.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        In the Srimad Bhagavata the Lord Sri Krishna says to Uddhava, "I am
        not so easily attainable by Yoga, Sankhya or discrimination, Dharma,
        study of the Vedas, Tapas, renunciation, liberal gifts, charitable
        acts, rites such as Agnihotra, fasts, vows, secret Mantras, resort to
        pilgrimages, Yamas, Niyamas (moral rules), as by Satsanga (company of
        Sadhus or the wise) which puts an end to all attachments. It is only
        by association with the wise and the righteous, that many who were of
        Rajasic or Tamasic nature-such as Vritra, son of the sage Tvashtri ;
        Prahlada, the Daityas, the Asuras and the Rakshasas, Gandharvas,
        Apsaras, Nagas, Siddhas, Charanas, Guhyakas and Vidyadharas, many
        beasts and birds, and among mankind Vaisyas, Sudras, women and
        outcastes who are of the lowest birth, have attained Me. Vrishaparva,
        Bali, Bana, Maya, Vibhishana, Sugriva, Hanuman; Jambavan, the bear;
        Gajendra, the elephant; Jatayu, the vulture; Tuladhara, the merchant;
        Dharmavyadha, the fowler; Kubja, the hunch-backed perfume-seiler; the
        Gopis 'in Vraja, the wives of the Brahmanas engaged in sacrifices in
        Brindavana, and others-all these did not study the Vedas, did not sit
        at the feet of great men of learning for the sake of knowledge. They
        did not observe any vows or fasts. They did not perform Tapas but they
        attained Me through association with saints and Sadhus. Through love
        alone, developed through the company of saints, the Gopis and even the
        cows, trees, beasts, serpents and others of dull-witted nature, became
        perfected and easily attained Me whom one does not attain by making
        great endeavours through Yoga or Sankhya, charity, vows, Tapas,
        sacrifices, teaching and study of the Vedas or renunciation.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Satsanga or association with the sages removes the darkness of the
        heart. It is a safe boat to cross the ocean of Samsara. Satsanga
        elevates the mind and fills it with Sattva or purity. It eradicates
        vicious thoughts and impressions in the heart. It leads one to the
        right path and causes the Sun of Wisdom to shine upon one's mind.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You may do Japa of 'Om Namah Sivaya' Mantra, if you are a votary of
        Lord Siva, or 'Om Namo Narayanaya' if you are a devotee of Lord
        Vishnu. These are very powerful Mantras. None can explain the benefits
        of Japa, Sadhana and Satsanga. Japa is the rod in the hands of the
        blind Sadhakas to plod on the road to realisation. Japa is the
        philosopher's stone or divine elixir that makes one God-like. Through
        Japa alone one can realise God in this life.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        This book will throw much light on the important subject of Mantra
        Yoga and the method of attaining perfection through Japa. The First
        Chapter gives the definition of Japa. The Second Chapter deals with
        the glory and importance of the Name of God. Different kinds of
        Mantras are given in the Third Chapter. The Fourth Chapter contains
        many practical and useful instructions on Sadhana. The Fifth Chapter
        gives a short sketch of the lives of some of the saints who realised
        God through Japa.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        May God give you inner strength to control the Indriyas and the mind
        and to practise Japa Yoga and worship uninterruptedly! May you have
        unshakable faith in the miraculous powers and marvellous benefits of
        Japa Yoga! May you all realise the glory of Nama, the Name of God! May
        you all spread the glory of Nama throughout the length and breadth of
        the land! Victory to Hari and His Name! Glory to Hari and His Name!
        May the blessings of Lord Siva, Hari, Rama and Krishna be upon you
        all!

      <h2 class="lesson-header">Lesson 2 - Hints on Japa Yoga Sadhana</h2>
      <ol class="lesson-text">
        <li>
          Man cannot live by bread alone; but he can live repeating the Name
          of the Lord alone.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Yogi crosses the ocean of Samsara by his Chittavritti-Nirodha,
          controlling the modifications that arise in the mind; a Jnani by his
          Brahmakara-VriUi (by raising the pure thought of Infinity); and a
          Bhakta by doing Nama-Smarana. The Name of the Lord has a very great
          power. It gives eternal bliss. It bestows immortality (Amritatva).
          Through its power you can have direct vision of the Lord. It brings
          you face to face with the Supreme Being and makes you realise your
          oneness with the Infinite and the whole world at large. What a
          wonderful, magnetic, electrifying influence the Name of the Lord
          possesses! Feel it, my dear friends, by chanting His Name and
          rolling the beads. One who does not do Smarana of Hari is a Neecha
          (low-born). The day spent without the remembrance of His Name is a
          mere waste.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was by the glory of Rama-Nama that the stones floated in water,
          and the bridge, the Sethu over the sea, was built by Sugriva and his
          companions, at Ramesvara. It was Hari-Nama that cooled Prahlada,
          when he was thrown into a conflagration of fire.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any Nama of the Lord is nectar. It is sweeter than sugar-candy. It
          gives immortality to the Jivas. It is the essence of the Vedas.
          Amrita came out, in days of yore, during the process of the churning
          of the ocean by the Devas and the Asuras. By churning the four
          Vedas, the Name of Rama, the nectar, was brought out to quench the
          three kinds of Taapas of the ignorant Jivas. Drink it again and
          again by constant repetition, just as Valmiki did in days long gone
          by.
        </li>
        <li>
          That bungalow or palace or a place in which or where no
          Hari-Sankirtana or worship is done is only a burial ground, even
          though it is furnished with sofas, electric lights and electric
          fans, fine gardens, and such other things.
        </li>
        <li>
          Renounce everything. Live on alms. Live in seclusion. Repeat 'Om
          Namo Narayanaya' fourteen crore times. This can be done within four
          years. Do one lakh times Japa daily. You can see Hari face to face.
          Can you not undergo a little suffering for a short period when you
          can thereby get the fruit of immortality, infinite peace and eternal
          happiness?
        </li>
        <li>
          Japa is a very great purifier. It checks the force of the
          thought-current moving towards objects. It forces the mind to move
          towards God, towards the attainment of eternal bliss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Japa eventually helps in obtaining Darsana of God. The
          Mantra-Chaitanya is hidden in every Mantra.
        </li>
        <li>
          Japa reinforces the Sadhana-Sakti of the Sadhaka. It makes him
          morally and spiritually strong.
        </li>
        <li>
          The vibration produced by the chanting of a Mantra corresponds to
          the original vibration that arose from Hiranyagarbha.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rhythmical vlbration produced through Japa regulates the
          unsteady vibrations of the five sheaths.
        </li>
        <li>
          Japa changes the mind-stuff from worldliness to spirituality, from
          Rajas and activity to Sattva and illumination.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Name of the Lord is an inexhaustible storehouse of spiritual
          knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even mechanical repetition of a Mantra plays a great part in the
          evolution of the soul. Even a simple parrot-like gramophonic
          repetition of a Mantra, too, is beneficial. It has got its own
          effect.

          In the Satya-Yuga meditation has been prescribed as the principal
          form of discipline, as the minds of men were generally pure and free
          from distractions.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Treta-Yuga sacrifices were prescribed, as materials for the
          performance of Yajna were easily procurable then, and as people were
          slightly Rajasic.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Dvapara-Yuga worship was recommended as the principal form of
          Sadhana, as there was greater facility for direct worship of God,
          and as there was a greater manifestation of the sportive energy of
          God.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Kali-Yuga, as the mind of men are naturally prone to greater
          distractions, meditation, worship and performance of sacrifices are
          not possible. Therefore, loud chanting of the Divine Name or Kirtan
          or Namasmarana (remembrance of the Lord's Name) has been recommended
          as the principal Sadhana for God-realisation.
        </li>
        <li>
          God's Name is your boat, Sankirtan is your raft. Cross this ocean of
          Sam sara with this boat and raft.
        </li>
        <li>
          No one obtains liberation without the Name of the Lord. Your highest
          duty is to repeat His Name always. Name is the greatest Treasure of
          treasures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rama-Nama is the true substance of the four Vedas. He who repeats
          'Rama, Rama', pouring out tears of love, attains life eternal and
          everlasting bliss. The Name 'Rama' will guide him on the path.
          Therefore, say 'Rama, Rama'.
        </li>
        <li>
          He who recites Sri Rama's Name can never come to grief. Lord Rama is
          the bestower of blessedness. He has the power to liberate people
          from the unceasing round of births and deaths.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Name of Hari is, undoubtedly, the surest, safest and the easiest
          means of expiating sins. This is a well-known fact.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Name of the Lord is the unfailing source of strength. In the
          darkest hour of your trial, only God's Name will save you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prahlada, Dhruva and Sanaka realised God through Namasmarana or
          remembrance of the Lord's Name.
        </li>
        <li>
          The greatest of sinners can attain God-realisation through the
          blessings of the Name.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meditate on God's Name with the belief that the Name and Named (God)
          are identical.
        </li>
        <li>
          Japa or recitation of the Lord's Name purges the mind of all
          impurities and fills it with bliss. It attunes the soul with God and
          fills it with His presence. It brings about perfect communion of the
          soul with God.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take refuge in the Lord with all your being, and chant His Name with
          devotion. This is the final verdict of the Sastras and the
          considerate opinion of the saints.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chanting of the Lord's Name brightens the mirror of mind, burns the
          forest of desires and bathes the whole being in a flood of joy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resist temptation by taking refuge in the Name of the Lord. Have
          love for solitude and silence. Have the inward life. All miseries
          will terminate. You will enjoy supreme felicity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strike the chords in your heart by chanting Om, by doing Japa of Om
          Namah Sivaya, by singing Hare Rama, Hare Krishna; and hear the
          thrilling, eternal superb music of the Soul.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat constantly 'Om Nama Bhagavate Vaasudevaya', the
          Dvadasa-Akshara or the twelve-lettered Mantra of Sri Krishna, the
          joy of Gokula, the delight of Sri Radha, the darling of Nanda, and
          obtain His grace and Darsana.
        </li>
        <li>
          God is the one Doctor for all sicknesses. Rely on Him alone. The
          Names of God are the most potent, unfailing tonics, sure panaceas,
          well-tried elixirs, sovereign specifics.

      <h2 class="lesson-header">Lessons 3-5 - Sadhana in Depth</h2>
      <h3>1. Need for a Guru</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        A Guru is necessary. The spiritual path is beset with many obstacles.
        The Guru will guide the aspirants safely and remove all sorts of
        obstacles and difficulties.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Guru, Isvara, Brahman, Truth and OM are one. Serve the Guru with
        intense Bhakti (Guru Seva). Please him in all possible ways. Have the
        mind fixed on Guru as Atman (Atma-Lakshya). Obey him implicitly. His
        words must be gospel truths for you. Then only you will improve. You
        will get His Grace. There is no other way.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You will have to deify your Guru. You must superimpose all the
        attributes of Isvara and Brahman on him. You must take him as an
        actual God incarnate. You must never look into his Doshas or defects.
        You should see only the Divinity in him. Then only you will realise
        Brahman in and through the Guru.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The physical form of the Guru will slowly vanish. You will realise the
        Vyapaka (all-pervading) Atman in and through him. You will see your
        Guru in all forms, animate and inanimate.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        There is no other way for overhauling the vicious worldly Samskaras
        and the passionate nature of raw, worldly-minded persons than the
        personal contact with and service of the Guru.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        An aspirant who, with great devotion, attends on his Guru in his
        personal services, quickly purifies his heart. This is the surest and
        easiest way for self-purification; I assure you boldly.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        It is better if you get your Mantra from your Guru. This has a
        tremendous effect on the disciple. The Guru imparts his Sakti along
        with the Mantra. If you cannot get a Guru, you can select any Mantra
        according to your own liking and taste and repeat it mentally, daily,
        with Sraddha and Bhava. This also has a great purificatory effect. You
        will attain the realisation of God.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Meditation Room</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Have a separate meditation room under lock and key. Do not allow
        anybody to enter the room. Burn incense there in the morning and in
        the evening. Keep a picture of Lord Krishna, Lord Siva or Sri Rama or
        Devi in the room. Place your Asana in front of the picture. When you
        repeat the Mantra, the powerful vibrations set up by it will be lodged
        in the ether of the room (Akasic records). In six months' time you
        will feel peace and purity in the atmosphere of the room. There will
        be a peculiar magnetic aura in the room. You will actually feel this
        if you are sincere in your practice.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Whenever your mind is much disturbed by antagonistic worldly
        influences, sit in the room and repeat the Name of the Lord for at
        least half an hour. Then immediately you will find an entire change in
        your mind. Practise this, and feel the soothing spiritual influence,
        yourself. Nothing is so great as spiritual Sadhana. You will find, as
        a result of this, a local Mussoorie (a hill-station) in your own house
        without any expense.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Repeat the Name of the Lord with devotion in your heart. You will
        realise God quickly. This is the easiest method in this age. There
        must be Niyama (rule) in Sadhana. You must systematically and
        regularly do this. God does not want precious presents. Many people
        spend millions of rupees in opening hospitals and reading houses. But
        they do not give their hearts. A Bhakta (devotee) should have in his
        heart the all-pervading Rama, though he may see outside the concrete
        form of Rama with bow and arrows. Rama, like OM, is all-pervading. God
        is Dhyana-Gamya (obtainable through meditation) and Anubhava-Gamya
        (can be realised by spiritual experience or direct perception or
        realisation). He is Japa-Gamya (obtainable through Japa).
      </p>
      <h3>3. Brahmamuhurta</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Get up at 4 O'clock in the morning, at Brahmamuhurta, which is very
        favourable for spiritual contemplation, and start doing Japa. In the
        early morning, after slumber, the mind is calm, pure and quite
        refreshed. The mind is like a blank sheet of paper and comparatively
        free from worldly Samskaras (impressions of Vyavahara) then. It can be
        moulded very easily at this time. The atmosphere also is charged with
        more Sattva at this particular time. Wash your hands, feet and face
        with cold or warm water, if you find it difficult to take a bath. This
        will suffice. Now, start doing Japa.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Selection of Ishta Devata</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You can select your Ishta Devata-Siva, Krishna, Rama, Vishnu ,
        Dattatreya, Gayatri, Durga or Kaali-according to the advice of your
        own inclination or on consultation with a good astrologer who will
        select the Deity according to the nature of your planet and sign of
        the zodiac. Every one of us has done worship of some Devata in our
        previous births. The Samskaras are in the subconscious mind. So
        naturally, everyone of us has an inclination towards a particular
        Devata. If you had worshipped Lord Krishna in your previous birth,
        naturally you will have an inclination to Lord Krishna in this birth
        also.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        When you are in great agony and distress you will naturally utter a
        certain Name of God. This will give you the clue to find out your
        Ishta Devata. If a scorpion has stung you severely, you may utter 'Hey
        Rama'; another may utter 'Hey Krishna'; while a third may utter 'Hey
        Narayana'; and a fourth may utter 'Hey Siva'. The calling of a
        particular Name is due to Purva Samskaras. If you had worshipped Rama
        in the previous birth, naturally you will utter 'Hey Rama' when you
        are stung by a scorpion, and so on.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Asana for Japa</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Sit on Padma, Siddha, Svastika or Sukha Asana for half an hour to
        start with. Then gradually increase the period to three hours. In one
        year you can have Asana-Siddhi (perfection in posture). Any easy and
        comfQrtable posture is Asana.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Keep the head, neck and trunk in one straight line. Spread a fourfold
        blanket on the ground, and over this spread a piece of soft, white
        cloth. This will be quite enough. If you can get a good tiger-skin,
        complete with claws, etc., it is all the more better. A tiger-skin has
        got its own advantages. It generates electricity in the body quickly
        and does not allow leakage of electric current from the body. It is
        full of magnetism.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Face the East or the North while you are on the Asana. A spiritual
        neophyte should observe this rule. By facing the North you will be in
        communion with the Rishis of the Himalayas and will be mysteriously
        benefited by their spiritual currents.
      </p>
      <h4>Padmasana</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Sit on your seat. Keep the left foot over the right thigh and the
        right foot over the left thigh. Keep the hands on the knees. Sit
        erect. This is Padmasana, highly suitable for Japa and Dhyana.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Where to Concentrate</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Concentrate gently either on the lotus of the heart (Anahata-Chakra)
        or on the space between the two eyebrows (Ajna-Chakra). Ajna-Chakra is
        the seat of the mind, according to the Hatha Yogic school. The mind
        can be controlled easily if anyone concentrates on this Ajna-Chakra.
        Sit on your seat, close your eyes and begin to do Japa and meditation.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Fixing one's eyes between the eyebrows is called Bhrumadhya-Drishti.
        Sit on Padmasana, Siddhasana or Svastikasana, in your meditation room
        and practise this gaze gently from half a minute to half an hour.
        There must not be even the least violence in this practice. Gradually
        increase the period. This Yogic Kriya removes Vikshepa or tossing of
        mind and develops concentration. Lord Krishna prescribes this practice
        in Chapter V-27 of the Bhagavadgita; "Having external contacts
        excluded , and with gaze fixed between the eyebrows", etc. This is
        known as the "Frontal Gaze", because here the eyes are directed
        towards the frontal bone or the bone of the forehead.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Sit on your seat and fix the gaze on the tip of the nose, from half a
        minute to half an hour. Do this practice gently. Do not strain the
        eyes. Gradually increase the period. This is Nasal Gaze or
        Nasikagra-Drishti. You can select for yourself either the Frontal or
        the Nasal Gaze. Even when you pass along the road , practise this
        gaze. You will have wonderful concentration. The Japa can go on nicely
        even while you are walking.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Some students like to concentrate with open eyes, while some others
        with closed eyes, and again some others with half opened eyes. If you
        meditate with closed eyes, dust or foreign particles will not fall
        into your eyes. Some students whom lights and jerks trouble, prefer
        concentration with open eyes. Some, who meditate with closed eyes are
        overpowered by sleep within a short time. If beginners start
        concentrating with open eyes, the mind will wander to objects. Use
        your common-sense and adopt that method which suits you best. Overcome
        other obstacles by suitable intelligent methods. Remember the story of
        "Bruce and the Spider." Be patient and persevering. Struggle hard, and
        win the spiritual battle. Become a spiritual hero, and wear the
        spiritual laurels round your neck.
      </p>
      <h3>7. Three Sittings for Doing Japa</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        There is a special, mysterious spiritual force or wonderful magnetic
        power at the Sandhi or junction of time, at sunrise and sunset. The
        mind then will be elevated quickly and filled with Sattva.
        Concentration at this time will come by itself without any effort.
        Japa should be done at the Sandhis. Now the mind is quite calm and
        refreshed. You should catch the meditative wave now; meditation is
        more important than anything else. After this, you can take up the
        Asanas and Pranayama and finish up the full course by another short
        sitting for doing Japa and meditation. As there is always some sort of
        drowsiness when you start the practice, it is desirable to do some
        Asanas and a little Pranayama, at least for five minutes, just to
        drive off this drowsiness, and to make you fit for Japa and
        meditation.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The mind acquires one-pointedness after the practice of Pranayama.
        Therefore you will have to take to Japa and meditation after Pranayama
        is over. Pranayama, though it is concerned with the breath, gives good
        exercise to the various internal organs, and the whole body. It is the
        best form of physical exercise ever known.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        If you are tired of repeating the Mantra at one stroke, have 3 or more
        sittings, say, in the morning from 4 O'clock to 7, in the evening from
        4 to 5, and at night from 6 to 8. Repeat the Mantra very, very quickly
        for sometime, when you find that the mind is wandering much. The
        golden rule is to repeat the Mantra neither too slow nor too quick.
        Observe the happy medium. The Aksharas of the Mantra should be
        pronounced properly. And also, the Mantra should be repeated
        Akshara-Laksha. If there are 5 Aksharas or letters in the Mantra it
        should be repeated 5 lakh times. This is Akshara-Laksha repetition.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        If you sit by the side of a river, lake or well, in a temple, at the
        foot or top of a mountain, in a lovely garden or solitary room, the
        mind will be focused quite easily, without much effort. If you repeat
        the Mantra, when the stomach is overloaded, you will feel drowsy. Take
        light Sattvic food. Repeat any prayer and then sit for Japa. The mind
        will then be elevated. You will find it pleasant to rotate the beads
        easily. You must use your common-sense throughout your spiritual
        practice. For sometime you can visit holy places like Rishikesh,
        Haridwar, Varanasi, etc. , and there you can do Japa on the banks of
        holy rivers like the Ganga. You will find marked improvement. As the
        mind, while in such sacred places, is free from business, worries and
        family-anxieties, you can have an efficient turn of Japa owing to good
        concentration there. Record the Japa in your spiritual diary.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Keep a diary to record the number of Japa daily. When you roll the
        beads do not use the index finger. Use the right thumb and the middle
        finger. Cover your fingers with a piece of cloth or a towel or a
        specially made cap. Others should not see you roiling the beads.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Introspect. Look within. Watch the mind and its Vrittis
        (thought-waves) carefully. Sit in a solitary room for sometime. Just
        as the mind wants variety in eating, it wants variety in Japa also.
        When it gets tired of Manasika Japa, when you notice that it has begun
        to wander about, take to loud repetition. The ears also will hear the
        Mantra. There will be more concentration now for sometime. One
        disadvantage in loud repetition is that you get tired of it after
        about an hour. You will have to combine the three methods, viz.,
        Manasika Japa, Upamsu Japa and Vaikhari Japa to the best advantage.
        Use your common-sense. A beginner with a coarse and gross mind
        (Sthula-Buddhi) will find it difficult to do Manasika Japa to start
        with.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Manasika Japa of Rama-Mantra can be associated with the breath as in
        "Soham" Japa or Ajapa-Japa. A Japa that is done without moving the
        lips is Ajapa. When you inhale the air repeat mentally 'Ra'; when you
        exhale repeat mentally 'Ma'. Keep up the practice even during walking.
        For sometime, this method would appear easy. During meditation inside
        the room you can have this practice. This is the Ajapa way of doing
        Rama-Mantra-Japa.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Need for a Maala</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You must have a rosary or Japa-Maala always in your pocket or neck and
        underneath your pillow at night when you go to sleep. It will remind
        you of God when you forget Him owing to the force of Maya or Avidya
        (ignorance). At night when you get up for micturition, the Maala will
        remind you to roll it once or twice. A Maala is a strong weapon, as it
        were, to annihilate the mind. It is a powerful whip to goad the mind
        towards God or Brahman. A Rudraksha-Maala or a Tulasi-Maala of 108
        beads can be used while doing Japa.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Just as the ideas of courts, cases, documents and clients get
        associated with your mind when you see or think of a lawyer, just as
        the ideas of dispensary, patients, drugs, chemicals, diseases and
        hospitals get associated when you see or think of a doctor, so also
        the ideas of Sanctity, Purity, Divinity, Divine Glory, Divine
        Splendour, Divine Wisdom, Divine Power, Divine Love, Omnipotence, and
        all such Divine attributes get associated with the mind when you see
        or think of a Maala. Therefore wear the Maala always round your neck
        and do Japa with it. Do not feel shy to wear this, 0 educated persons!
        This will always remind you of God and God-realisation. This is more
        valuable than a golden necklace bedecked with nine kinds of precious
        stones, because this fills your mind with Divine thoughts, and is the
        instrument to take you to the Goal and liberate you from the Samsaric
        wheel of birth and death.
      </p>
      <h3>9. How to Use a Japa-Maala</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Generally a Japa-Maala or rosary contains 108 beads. One bead among
        these will be slightly bigger than the rest. This is called the Meru.
        This is the guiding bead to indicate that you have done 108 times Japa
        of a particular Mantra. In doing Japa with the Maala you should note
        that you do not cross the Meru bead. When you come to this bead you
        should turn your fingers back and begin the next Maala of Japa from
        the last bead of the previous Maala. Thus you should turn your fingers
        whenever you finish a Maala of Japa, but should not cross the Meru.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        While doing Japa with the Maala, the index finger (the finger next to
        the thumb) should not be used. The thumb and the third finger should
        roll the beads.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text"></p>
      <h3>10. How to Count J apa</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        If you have no Maala, you can, for counting the number of Japa done,
        use the fingers of your right hand. The left thumb can dexterously
        count the number of Japa along the three lines in each finger. After
        you have finished one Maala of Japa put your left thumb on the first
        line of the little finger. Then raise it to the line above, and so on.
        When you finish all the lines of the five fingers it will come to 15
        Maalas. You can repeat this again. Or you can use small pieces of
        stones for each Maala or for every 15 Maalas. Or there is another
        method. Mark with the help of a watch placed in front of you how much
        Japa you are able to do in 2 hours. If within 2 hours you are able to
        do 12,600 times Rama-Japa or OM-Japa, repeat thus for 2 hours on the
        following days also. You have now an easy ready reckoner with you.
        Japa of OM or Rama for a period of 2 hours means repetition of the
        same 12,600 times.
      </p>
      <h3>11. Three Varieties of Japa</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Repeat the Mantra verbally for sometime, in a whisper for sometime,
        and mentally for sometime. The mind wants variety. It gets disgusted
        with any monotonous practice. The mental repetition is very powerful.
        It is termed Manasika Japa. The verbal repetition is called Vaikhari
        Japa. Repetition in a whisper or humming is termed Upamsu Japa. Even
        mechanical repetition of Japa without any Bhava has a great purifying
        effect on the heart or the mind. The feeling will come later on when
        the process of mental purification goes on.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The loud Japa shuts out all worldly sounds. There is no break of Japa
        here. This is one advantage in loud Japa. Manasika Japa is difficult
        for ordinary people, and break may come in the mind after a while.
        Whenever sleep tries to overpower you when doing Japa at night, take
        the Maala in your hand and roll the beads. This will put a check to
        sleep. This is another advantage in loud Japa. Repeat the Mantra
        loudly. Give up Manasika Japa at this time. The Maala will remind you
        of the stoppage of Japa. When sleep comes in, stand up and do the
        Japa.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Sandilya says in Sandilya Upanishad: "The Vaikhari Japa (loud
        pronunciation) gives the reward as stated in the Vedas; while the
        Upamsu Japa, whispering or humming, which cannot be heard by anyone,
        gives a reward a thousand times more than the Vaikhari; the Manasika
        Japa (mental Japa) gives a reward a crore times more than the Vaikhari
        Japa."
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Do Japa in the throat or Kantha for one year. This is verbal Japa or
        Vaikhari Japa in a loud tone. Do it in the heart or Hridaya for two
        years. This is mental or Manasika Japa. Do it in the Nabhi or navel
        for one year. This kind of Japa is associated with the breath.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        When you advance in practice, every pore in the skin, every hair on
        the body, will repeat the Mantra forcibly. The whole system will be
        charged with the powerful vibrations of the Mantra. You will be even
        in the Prema or Love of the Lord. You will experience muscular
        twitchings and will shed profuse tears of Ananda. You will be in an
        exalted Divine mood. You will get inspiration, revelation, ecstasy,
        insight, intuition and Parama-Ananda. You will compose inspiring
        poems. You will have various Siddhis, Divine Aisvarya, treasures of
        Heaven.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Repeat the Name of the Lord constantly. This will lead quite easily to
        the control of mind. Do it with absolute Sraddha (faith). Do it with
        Antarika Prema (love from the bottom of your heart) and Anuraga
        (intense affection). You must intensely feel for the long, painful
        separation from Him. Tears must flow profusely from your eyes. This is
        Virahagni. When you repeat His Name, remember that He is dwelling in
        the chambers of your heart, in the Anahata-Chakra, with conch, disc,
        mace and lotus in His hands, in the midst of a blazing light, dressed
        in yellow silken robe, with Srivatsa and Kaustubha gem on His chest.
      </p>
      <h3>12. Mulabandha and Kumbhaka in Japa</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        When you sit on the Asana for doing Japa, press the genitals (Yoni)
        with the left heel (if you are sitting in Siddhasana) and contract the
        anus (Guda), the terminal opening of the alimentary canal. This is
        termed Mulabandha in Hatha Yogic practice. This helps concentration.
        The practice prevents the Apana-Vayu from moving downwards. If you are
        seated in Padmasana you can do Mulabandha without pressing the
        genitals with the heel.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Retain the breath also as long as you can comfortably. This is
        Kumbhaka. This will steady the mind considerably and increase the
        power of concentration. You will feel an intense spiritual bliss.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        When you repeat the Mantra, do it remembering the meaning of the
        Mantra-Rama, Siva, Krishna, Narayana-all these mean ultimately
        Sat-Chit-Ananda, purity, perfection, all-light, eternity and
        immortality.
      </p>

      <h3>13. Japa Plus Karma Yoga</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Even when you do manual work, give your hands alone to work, but give
        the mind to God (do mental Japa of the Mantra), like the typist or the
        harmonium-player who types or plays and talks to you, or like the lady
        who knits clothes and talks and jokes with her comrades while she is
        walking along the road. You will be able to do two things at a time by
        practice. The manual work will become automatic, mechanical or
        instinctive. You will have two minds, as it were, for the time being.
        A portion of the mind will be in the service of the Lord, in
        meditation, in Japa, even while working. Repeat the Name of the Lord
        while at work also. Ashtavadhanis do eight things at a time. They play
        at cards, move the man in Chaturanga-play (chess play), dictate some
        passages to a third man, talk to a fourth man in order and
        continuation, and so on. This is a question of training the mind. Even
        so, you can so train the mind that you can work with the hands and
        also remember God at the same time. This is Karma Yoga and Bhakti Yoga
        combined. The Lord Krishna says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Tasmat Sarveshu Kaleshu Mamanusmara Yudhya Cha, Mayyarpita-manobuddhir
        Mamevaishyasyasamsayam.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "Therefore at all times think of Me and fight; with mind and reason
        set on Me, without doubt, thou shalt come unto Me alone".
      </blockquote>
      <cite>(Gita, VIII-7)</cite>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        "Therefore at all times think of Me and fight; with mind and reason
        set on Me, without doubt, thou shalt come unto Me alone" (Gita,
        VIII-7).
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Though the cow grazes on the pasture, having been separated from the
        calf, her mind is always fixed SADl-I ANA 97 on the calf alone.
        Similarly, you should fix the mind on God when you do Japa, and give
        your hands to work which is only worship of the Lord.
      </p>
      <h3>14. Likhita Japa</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Write down daily in a notebook your Ishta Mantra or Guru-Mantra, for
        half an hour. When you write the Mantra, observe Mouna. Write the
        Mantra clearly in ink. On Sundays and holidays, write this for one
        hour. In a common place collect your friends also and let them write
        the Mantras. This is Likhita Japa. You can develop a wonderful power
        of concentration. Prescribe this to all of your family-members.
        Incalculable spiritual benefits are derived from Likhita Japa
        (Mantra-writing).
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Of the various methods of Japa described in the scriptures, viz.,
        Vaikhari, Upamsu and Manasika, etc., Likhita Japa is very efficacious.
        It helps the Sadhaka in concentration of the mind and gradually leads
        to meditation.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        An aspirant should select the Mantra of his tutelary deity, or Ishta,
        according to his liking or inclination. Repetition of the same Mantra
        with meaning and Bhava should be practised both orally and in writing.
        For oral Japa, the help of a Maala or rosary is required. For Likhita
        Japa a notebook and a pen should be used. In Mantra-writing there is
        no restriction about any particular script. It may be written in any
        language. The following rules may be observed while practising
        Mantra-writing:
      </p>
      <ol class="lesson-text">
        <li>
          Regularity and punctuality of time should be observed. This would
          itself bring the requisite help and be of the utmost benefit to the
          Sadhaka.
        </li>
        <li>
          Physical and mental purity should be observed. Before sitting for
          Mantra-writing, the face, hands and feet should be washed. Effort
          should be made to keep the mind pure during Mantra-writing. Drive
          out all worldly thoughts while writing Mantra.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to sit in one pose as long as possible. Frequent change of
          a pose or Asana should be avoided. Sitting in one Asana would
          increase your power of endurance and also considerable energy will
          be preserved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Observe silence during the practice. Too much of speaking results in
          waste of energy and waste of time. Silence helps in an increased
          outturn of work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid looking hither and thither. Fix your eyes on the notebook.
          This would help concentration of mind during the practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the Mantra mentally also while writing it in the notebook.
          This will make a threefold impression in your mind. Gradually your
          whole being will be involved and engrossed in the Mantra.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fix a particular number of Mantras for one sitting. This will keep
          your practice intact and you will never get out of touch with the
          Mantra.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you have once started the practice, do not leave it till you
          have finished the daily quota of one sitting. Do not allow your mind
          to be diverted to other engagements, as this would be an obstruction
          in the Sadhana. Have at least half an hour's writing at one sitting.
        </li>
        <li>
          To help concentration, one uniform system of writing from top to
          bottom or from left to right, may be maintained during a particular
          sitting. The whole Mantra should be written at once in continuity.
          Do not break the Mantra in the middle when you come to the end of a
          line.
        </li>
        <li>
          When a Mantra is selected by you, try to stick to it tenaciously.
          Frequent change of Mantra is not advisable.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The above rules if strictly observed, will help you much in your quick
        evolution. You will develop concentration wonderfully. By prolonged
        and constant practice the inherent power of SADHANA 101 the Mantra
        (Mantra-Sakti) will be awakened, which will fill your very existence
        with the Divinity of the Mantra.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The notebook should be well kept and treated with respect and purity.
        When completed, it should be stocked in a box and kept in your
        meditation room in front of the Lord's picture. The very presence of
        these Mantra-notebooks will create favourable vibrations requisite for
        your Sadhana.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The benefits of Mantra-writing or Likhita Japa cannot be adequately
        described. Besides bringing about purity of heart and concentration of
        mind, Mantra-writing gives you control of Asana, control of Indriyas,
        particularly the sight and the tongue, and fills you with the power of
        endurance. You attain peace of mind quickly. You approach nearer to
        God through Mantra-Sakti. These benefits can be experienced only
        through regular and incessant practice of Likhita Japa. Those who are
        not conversant with this Yoga should start the practice immediately
        and even if they take to this practice for half an hour daily, they
        will realise its benefits within six months.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text"></p>
      <h3>15. Number of Japas</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Every man is unconsciously repeating the "Soham" Mantra 21,600 times
        daily within 24 hours. You should repeat your Ishta Mantra at least 21
        ,600 times daily to correspond to the 21 ,600 natural (Soham) breaths
        that every living being takes in and exhales. Then the efficacy of the
        Mantra is great. The mind will be purified quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You must increase the number of Japa from 200 to 500 Maalas (each
        Maala contains 108 beads). Just as you are very keen in your taking
        food twice daily, tea in the morning and cocoa in the evening, etc.,
        you must evince extreme keenness in doing Japa also 4 times, in the
        morning, noon, evening and night. Death may come at any moment,
        without a second's notice. Prepare yourself to meet it with a smile,
        uttering Sri Rama, Sri Rama and merging in Rama, in Eternal Bliss,
        Infinite Glory, Ananda and Self-knowledge. Even on your tours you must
        do Japa and reading of Gita. Do you not eat and drink on your tour? Do
        not become ungrateful to the Inner Ruler (Antaryamin) who gives you
        daily bread and looks after you in every way. You can do Japa even in
        the latrine. But do it there mentally. Ladies can do Japa mentally
        even during their monthly periods. There are no restrictions of any
        kind in Mantra-Japa for those who do it with Nishkama-Bhava, for the
        attainment of Moksha. Restrictions or Vidhis come only when people
        repeat any Mantra with Sakama-Bhava, to get fruits, such as wealth,
        Svarga, son, and so on. You can wear Maalas around your neck even
        while answering the calls of nature.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Manasika Japa takes more time than the two other kinds of Japa. But
        some can do Manasika Japa more quickly. The mind becomes dull after
        some hours. It cannot turn out the work of Japa efficiently. The speed
        becomes lessened. Those who calculate the number of Maalas of Japa
        according to the watch should take recourse to rolling beads if there
        be any such dullness. If there be any pain in rolling the beads you
        can use a 'Japa Thaili ' or a bag for covering the fingers.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        It is always better to take to medium speed in Japa. It is not the
        speed but the Bhava and mental concentration that bring about the
        maximum benefits through Japa. There must be Akshara-Suddhi in
        repetition. Every word must be pronounced very clearly. There must not
        be mutilation of any word. This is very, very important. Some people
        finish one lakh of Japa daily, within 7 hours, in a hurried manner,
        just as a hired carpenter or mason or contractor does the work hastily
        in order to get his wages in the evening. Do not have any contract
        work with God. There cannot be any real devotion in having any
        contract with God. Of course there is one advantage in doing Japa with
        electric speed. If the mind is dull, if the mind is wandering wildly
        in sensual objects, you can keep a very high speed in doing Japa, for
        15 or 30 minutes. The high-speed-Japa will stimulate the dull mind and
        bring it back quickly to the Lakshya or the focussing point.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Those who take recourse to Purascharana and keeping up of daily
        spiritual diary should be very exact and accurate in keeping the
        record. There must be mathematical or scientific accuracy. They should
        watch the mind very carefully and, if it becomes dull during Japa,
        they should do more Japa to allow it a free margin. Immediately they
        should resort to Japa by Maala till dullness vanishes. It is better to
        take into consideration their number of Japa that is done when the
        mind is in full spirits and to omit that which is done when the mind
        is lethargic. Let whatever you do be genuine.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        In 14 hours you can do 3,000 Maalas of 'Hari Om' . Japa will stimulate
        the dull mind and bring it back to 'Sri Rama' Mantra. In half an hour
        you can do 10,000 times 'Sri Rama' Japa. If you do Japa of a Mantra 13
        crore times you will have Darsana of its Adi-Devata in physical form.
        If you are sincere and earnest you can do this within four years.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Those who wish to do Purascharana may live on milk and fruits. This
        makes the mind Sattvic. One will derive great spiritual benefits by
        living on pure Sattvic diet alone. The practice of Akhanda-Mouna
        (unbroken silence) during Purascharana is highly beneficial. Those who
        are not able to practise this, can observe full Mouna for a week in a
        month or only on Sundays. Those who practise Purascharana should not
        get up from the Asana till they finish the fixed number. They should
        not change the pose also. Counting can be done through Maala, fingers
        or watch.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The Brahma-Gayatri Mantra has twenty-four Aksharas or letters. So, one
        Gayatri-Purascharana constitutes the Japa of Gayatri Mantra 24 lakh
        times. There are various rules for Purascharana. If you repeat the
        Mantra 4,000 times daily, you should keep up that number daily, all
        throughout, till you finish the full 24 lakhs. Cleanse the mirror of
        the Manas of Mala (impurities) and prepare the ground for the sowing
        of the spiritual seed.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        As Omkara or Pranava is for Sannyasins, so is Gayatri for Brahmacharis
        and Grihasthas (householders). The fruits that are attained by
        meditation on Omkara can be attained by meditation on Gayatri also.
        The same goal that is reached by a Paramahamsa Sannyasin, can be
        reached by a Brahmachari or a householder by meditating on Gayatri.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Get up at 4 a.m., at Brahmamuhurta, and start Japa and meditation. If
        you find this difficult, get up at least before sunrise.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        It is better if you do Japa of Gayatri 3,000 to 4,000 times daily.
        Your heart will be rapidly purified. If you are not able to do this
        number of Japa, do it at least 108 times daily-36 times at sunrise, 36
        times at noon, and 36 times at sunset.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text"></p>
      <h3>16. Akhanda Japa</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Akhanda Japa of any Mantra can be done. The Akhanda Japa can be
        conducted for 12 hours or more according to convenience. This can be
        done on Sundays and other holidays when more leisure is at the
        disposal of the members. Any number of people can take part in Akhanda
        Japa. Even three, four, twelve or more members can conduct Akhanda
        Japa. Each member should be allotted at least one hour's time.
        Arrangements can be made previously regarding the hour of each
        particular member, when he will do the Japa.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Start the Japa at 6 a.m. and continue it up to 6 p.m. One member will
        do Japa for one hour, say from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. The next member is
        required to be present at least 5 minutes prior to his fixed time. He
        will wash his hands and feet, do Achamana and sit near the preceding
        member, take up his Maala and start repeating the Mantra in a slightly
        audible tone. Thus the sitting member will know that his successor has
        taken up the Japa, and he may get up as soon as he finishes the Maala.
        Keep the eyes closed while doing Japa and seat yourself in the usual
        pose or Asana which you are accustomed to sit on. It is not absolutely
        necessary that the previous member should get up immediately when his
        successor relieves him. He may, if he so wishes, continue the Japa as
        before.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The number of Maalas may be recorded against each member's name.
        Towards the close of the Akhanda Japa all the members can assemble
        together and repeat the Mantra. At 6 p.m. have Arati before the Lord's
        picture and afterwards distribute the sacred Prasad.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The members should not be allowed to talk and disturb others. It would
        be highly beneficial if, along with the Japa, the members can fast, or
        observe at least partial fast by taking milk and fruits. Ladies also
        can take part in Akhanda Japa.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Collective Japa is highly beneficial. The Mantra-Sakti is awakened
        quickly. The Rajasic and Tamasic forces will be soon destroyed. More
        Sattva and harmony will pervade the place where Akhanda Japa is done.

        Lesson 6 - Practical aids and rules for japa
      </h2>
      <h3>Practical Aids to Japa</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        You have now a thorough knowledge of Japa Yoga and the glory of the
        Name. Now start real Sadhana from this minute. I have given below a
        number of practical hints of great use for your daily Sadhana. Note
        and follow them carefully.
      </p>
      <h4>Fixed Hours</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The most effective time is early dawn (Brahmamuhurta) and dusk, when
        Sattva is predominant. Regularity and being systematic are very
        essential.
      </p>
      <h4>Definite Place</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        It is highly advantageous to sit in the same place every day. Do not
        change it now and then.
      </p>
      <h4>A Steady Pose</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        A comfortable Asana helps to make the mind also steady, controls Rajas
        and aids concentration.
      </p>
      <h4>Face the North or East</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        This exercises a subtle influence and enhances the efficacy of Japa.
      </p>

      <h4>A Seat</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Deer-skin or Kusa-mat or a rug should be used. This helps to conserve
        body-electricity.
      </p>
      <h4>Repeat Elevated Prayer</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Invoking the aids of the Ishta Devata with appropriate prayer induces
        proper Sattvic Bhava.
      </p>
      <h4>Clear Articulation</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Now start the Japa pronouncing the Mantra distinctly and without
        mistakes.
      </p>
      <h4>Vigilance and Alert Attitude</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        This is a very important point. You will be fresh and alert when you
        commence. After a time the mind will unconsciously begin to wander,
        and drowsiness will overcome you. Keep widely alert throughout.
      </p>
      <h4>Japa Maala (Rosary)</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Using a Maala helps alertness and acts as an incentive to carry on the
        Japa continuously. Resolve to finish a certain minimum number of
        Maalas before leaving the seat.
      </p>
      <h4>Variety in Japa</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        This is necessary to sustain interest, avoid fatigue and counteract
        monotony. Repeat aloud for a time, then hum the Mantra and repeat
        mentally sometimes.
      </p>
      <h4>Meditation</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Side by side with Japa think of the Lord as present before you and
        picture His entrancing beautiful form. This practice adds tremendously
        to the efficacy or power of your Sadhana.
      </p>
      <h4>Concluding Prayer and Rest</h4>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        This is important. After Japa is over, do not immediately leave the
        place, mix with everyone or plunge into worldly activity. Sit very
        quietly for about 10 minutes at least, humming some prayer,
        remembering the Lord or reflecting upon His Infinite Love. Then, after
        devout prostration, leave the place and commence your routine duties.
        Spiritual vibrations will be intact.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Carry on your Sadhana with perseverance and tenacity, without break,
        and realise the glorious Goal of Life and enjoy the Supreme Bliss.
      </p>
      <h3>Rules for Japa</h3>
      <ol class="lesson-text">
        <li>
          Select any Mantra or Name of God (preferably that given by your
          Guru) and repeat it from 108 to 1080 times daily (one to ten
          Maalas).
        </li>
        <li>Use a Rudraksha or Tulasi Maala of 108 beads.</li>
        <li>
          Use only the middle finger and thumb of the right hand for rolling
          the beads. The index finger is prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not allow the Maala to hang below the navel. Keep the hand near
          the heart or the nose.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Maala must not be visible to you or others. Cover it with a
          towel or kerchief, which must be pure and washed daily.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not cross the Meru (crown or head) of the Maala while rolling the
          beads. Turn back when you come up to it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do mental Japa for some time. If the mind wanders, take to labial
          Japa (whispering or muttering) for some time, or loud Japa, by
          rotation, and come back to mental Japa again as soon as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a bath, or wash your hands, feet, face and mouth before sitting
          for Japa in the morning. At other times this is not absolutely
          necessary. Do Japa whenever you have leisure, specially during the
          Sandhyas or the junctions of the day (morning, noon and evening) and
          before going to bed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Associate the Japa with rhythmic breathing or Pranayama and meditate
          on the form of your Deity. Keep a pic- 80 JAPA YOGA ture or idol of
          the Deity in front. Think of the meaning of the Mantra while
          repeating it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pronounce each letter of the Mantra correctly and distinctly. Do not
          repeat it too fast or too slow. Increase the speed only when the
          mind wanders.
        </li>
        <li>Observe Mauna and avoid distractions, calls or engagements.</li>
        <li>
          Face the East or the North and sit in a separate meditation-room or
          any good place, such as temple, river-bank, under a banyan tree or a
          pee pal tree, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not beg of God any worldly objects while doing Japa. Feel that
          your heart is being purified and the mind is becoming steady by the
          power of the Mantra with the Grace of God.
        </li>
        <li>Keep your Guru-Mantra a secret. Never disclose it to anyone.</li>
        <li>
          Carry on the current of Japa mentally even at other times, in
          whatever works you may be engaged.
        </li>
