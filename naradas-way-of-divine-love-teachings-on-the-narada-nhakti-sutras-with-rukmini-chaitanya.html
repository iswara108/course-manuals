        <h3>Bhakti Yoga</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Bhakti Yoga is the path of devotion. In Bhakti Yoga we sublimate lower
          emotions into devotion, which is supreme love directed towards God.
          Bhakti Yoga is the approach of pure love, which is poured upon the
          chosen deity, or aspect of God. Through placing all his concentration
          on God, the devotee endeavors to increase his remembrance of and
          communion with the Lord. With faith, prayer and self-surrender he
          attains direct perception of his Ideal. When merging takes place and
          Oneness alone remains, the goal is reached.  Bhakti is attained
          through association with devotees (Satsanga). The 9 modes of Bhakti:

        <p class="lesson-text">There are 9 modes of practice in Bhakti Yoga:</p>

        <ol class="lesson-text">

        </ol>
        <h3>The five Bhavas in Bhakti Yoga</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Bhavas are inner devotional feelings and inner states of devotion
          experienced by the practitioners of Bhakti Yoga. The Bhavas are modes
          of relationship to God. The five Bhavas are:
        </p>

        <ol class="lesson-text">
          <li>
            Shanta Bhava <br />A pure feeling of peace devoid of desire,
            ignorance, and emotion. Its presence is not externally apparent.
            This is the devotional attitude of the Jnana Yogi. Bhishma is an
            example of a Bhakta with this kind of Bhava.  
          </li>
          <li>
            Dasya Bhava <br />
            The devotee regards himself as the servant of God. Hanuman is
            anexample of a Bhakta with this kind of Bhava. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Sakya Bhava <br />
            God is regarded as a spiritual friend to whom one can turn for
            advice, comfort, and companionship. Arjuna is an example of a Bhakta
            with this kind of Bhava. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Vatsalya Bhava <br />
            God is seen as a divine child. The relationship is that of a parent
            and a child. Yashoda&#39;s relationship with baby Krishna is an
            example of this kind of Bhava. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Mathurya Bhava <br />
            This is the feeling of the lover towards the beloved. It is pure
            love and not lust. Radha&#39;s relationship towards Krishna is an
            example of this Bhava.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The Narada Bhakti Sutras is a very popular treatise in India on Bhakti
          Yoga. This treatise is very lucid and practical in its exposition of
          the birth, growth, development, unfoldment and expression of Bhakti.
          This is a very useful book for earnest and sincere aspirants who tread
          the path of devotion.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          This book is a great standard work on Bhakti Yoga. It contains laconic
          aphorisms ascribed to Devarshi Narada.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The Holy Rishi Narada propounds the doctrine of love to God, a path
          which can easily be followed by the ordinary man. It does not demand
          either great knowledge of philosophy or total renunciation of the
          world.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Research students will find great help in this book in their study of
          the Psychology of Bhakti.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The Sutras have an expressible charm and beauty. They make a direct
          appeal to the heart. Narada speaks to all alike. There is not even the
          slightest trace or tinge of sectarianism.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          And they are the best authority on the Bhakti Marga. For sincere
          devotees who are in need of practical spiritual instructions, in a
          very short compass, in the path of devotion or divine love, there is
          no better book than Narada Bhakti Sutras. The language is very simple.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The Bhakti Sutras of Narada number 84 in all. The first twenty-four of
          them deal with the nature of Bhakti. The next nine Sutras, i.e., 25 to
          33 explain why and how the path of Bhakti is superior to Karma, Jnana
          and Yoga.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Sutras 34 to 50 (seventeen in all) describe the methods by which
          Bhakti may be practised and developed.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The next sixteen Sutras (51 to 66) give a description of the external
          marks by which Bhakti can be detected in a true devotee.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The last 18 Sutras (67 to 84) glorify the great realised souls who are
          full of devotion to the Lord.
        </p>

        <h3>Origin of Narada Bhakti Sutras</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Sri Veda Vyasa was staying in his hermitage of Badarikasrama. One day
          Narada went to the Ashram in the course of his wanderings. Sri Vyasa
          welcomed the Rishi with due rites and said, "Man seeks freedom, etc.
          But without devotion it is dry. Devotion is the only way for attaining
          salvation. All the others have importance only in so far as they are
          auxiliary to it. I humbly ask you to explain to me the virtue of
          devotion."
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Narada said, "Your disciple Jaimini has already discussed the problem
          of action in the Purva Mimamsa. You have yourself completed the
          enquiry of the problem of knowledge in the Uttara Mimamsa. Now you
          have taken up the problem of devotion. Its full explanation will be
          given by you in your Sri mad Bhagavatam. I shall explain Bhakti in the
          form of Sutras." So saying Narada delivered a discourse on devotion in
          84 aphorisms.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The collection of these Sutras forms a short treatise, known as
          Narada-Bhakti Sutras (Vide Srimad Bhagavatam 1-4 and 5).
        </p>

        <h3>Devotion</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The path of Bhakti consists of a gradation of steps. The desire for
          release from the evil of mortality and the sufferings is its starting
          point. Para Bhakti or Higher devotion is its goal. It is Para Bhakti
          that leads to Mukti.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Subsidiary to Para Bhakti, Ekanta-bhava, wholehearted devotion, there
          are various forms of devotional states, 81 in number.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Illiterates, females, outcastes-are all equally competent to follow
          the path of devotion. Desire for release or Mumukshutva is the minimum
          qualification.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          An objector says, God is far above the power of comprehension of man.
          How, then, can one cultivate devotion to Him?
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Live in the company of saints. Hear the Lilas of God. Study the sacred
          scriptures. Worship Him first in His several forms as manifested in
          the world. Worship any image or picture of the Lord or Guru. Recite
          His Name. Sing His glories. You will develop devotion.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          According to some, Jnana is instrumental in the cultivation of Bhakti,
          while others say that they are mutually dependent. But Narada says
          that Bhakti is the fruit or result of itself.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Devotion is the highest sentiment. Narada has dealt with the subject
          from the point of view of sentiment alone. Whereas the Bhakti-Mimamsa
          of Sandilya is an enquiry into the philosophy of devotion. The two
          treatises are companions. They supplement each other.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          When the devotees grows in devotion there is absolute
          self-forgetfulness. This is called Bhava. Bhava then grows into
          Maha-Bhava wherein the devotee lives, moves and has his being in the
          Lord. This is Parama-Prema, the consummation of love or supreme love.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The nine modes of Bhakti have each nine varieties. Therefore Saguna
          Bhakti becomes eighty-one fold.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          By fixing the mind on the Lord through love, hate, fear, friendship,
          many have attained God-realisation, e.g., the Gopis through love,
          Kamsa through fear, Sisupala through hate, the Vrishnis through
          relationship.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Devotion is indicated by Sanmana (honour) as in the case of Arjuna,
          Bahumana (exaltation) as in the case of Ikshvaku, Prithi (love) as in
          the case of Vidura, Viraha (pangs of separation) as in the case of
          Gopis, Itara-vichikitsa (disinclination to others) as in the case of
          Upamanyu, Mahima-Khyati (glorification) as in the case of Yama,
          Tadartha-prana-sthana (living for Him) as in the case of Hanuuman,
          Tadiyata (the belief that everything belongs to Him) as in the case of
          Uparichara Vasu, Sarva-tad-bhava (the consciousness that the Lord is
          immanent in all things) as in the case of Prahlada, A-pratikula
          (non-opposition) as in the case of Bhishma.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Bhakti Yoga is the one Yoga which directly appeals to the feelings of
          man. Apara Bhakti is lower Bhakti. It is a premature stage in
          devotion. Mature stage of subjective experience is known as Para
          Bhakti. The devotee has ineffable inner experience of unsurpassing
          bliss and illumination. He has God-realisation.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          There are two stages in Apara or lower Bhakti. The first stage is
          called Gauna or secondary; the second stage is Mukhya or primary. In
          Gauna Bhakti there is the influence of Rajo Guna; in Mukhya Bhakti
          there is influence of Sattva Guna. The mind is calm and serene.
          Meditation becomes firm and steady. The devotee is in the presence of
          God. He is conscious of duality.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          In Para Bhakti the devotee attains the full grace of the Lord,
          knowledge and full illumination. He merges in the Lord; he loses his
          identity. He becomes one with the Lord. Your happiness depends upon
          the nature of the object on which you set your heart. The only true
          object of love is the Lord who is omnipotent, omnipresent and
          omniscient and alI-merciful.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Love of God or devotion is more a practice than a philosophy. Devotion
          dethrones the ego and enthrones the Lord in its place. The climax of
          love is the love of God. Service of the saints, association with the
          saints, study of Bhakti literature, charity, self-restraint, humility,
          Japa, Kirtan, prayer-this is the preparation for the love of God.

        <h3>Life of Narada</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Deva Rishi Narada moves about playing on his Veena, singing the
          praises of Sri Hari drawing the hearts of people towards God thus
          radiating joy, love and peace throughout the afflicted world. Glory to
          Devarshi Narada!
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Through the power of Yoga he can go wherever he likes in the twinkling
          of an eye. The misunderstanding and quarrels he creates are all
          intended for the good of the world. He inspired Valmiki, Vyasa,
          Sukadeva, Prahlada, Dhruva and other great souls to practise devotion.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Narada was the son of a female servant in his former birth. A large
          number of saints, sages and Sannyasins came to his village during a
          certain rainy season to spend their four months of Chaturmas. Narada
          was a small child at that time. His mother engaged him in their
          service. He was not childish. He gave up all childish plays. He spoke
          very few words. He served them beautifully and wholeheartedly. He
          served all his time quietly at their feet. The Mahatmas were very much
          pleased with the boy. They were extremely kind to him. As ordered by
          them he ate what was left of the food left by them on the leaves. His
          sins were destroyed by this act. His heart became pure. He heard the
          beautiful stories of Sri Krishna recited by them. He gradually
          developed Bhakti. His mind became firm and steady. The Mahatmas gave
          him special instructions and revealed the secret of divine knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The Mahatmas left the village. The boy continued to practise Sadhana.
          He did Bhajan.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          One day a snake bit his mother and she died. The boy left the village
          and went to a dense forest. He sat underneath a Peepul tree on the
          bank of a river and meditated on Lord Hari.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The Lord revealed Himself in his heart. The hairs of his body stood
          erect. He forgot all about the world and even the consciousness of his
          own existence. He was immersed in the ocean of bliss.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Then suddenly the Form of Lord Hari disappeared. The boy was very much
          grieved. He again tried to have the vision of the Lord. He heard a
          voice from the sky: "0 Child! You cannot again get My vision in the
          present birth. I revealed Myself to you now in order to increase and
          strengthen your love towards Me. You have cultivated strong devotion
          to Me through the influence of Satsanga even for a short time. When
          you leave your present body, you will be a devotee very near and dear
          to Me. You will be attached to Me and you will remember through My
          grace the incidents of your present birth even after the termination
          of this Kalpa."
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The boy left the place and moved about in the world singing the
          glories and Names of the Lord. He gave up association with the world.
          In course of time his body perished. He attained the pure, divine body
          of a companion of God.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          At the end of the Kalpa he entered the heart of Brahma through His
          breath when he lay down on the ocean of dissolution, withdrawing the
          entire creation within Himself. At the end of a thousand Yugas, he
          came out from His breath with Maricha and other Rishis, when Brahma
          began to re-create the world.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Since then, Narada is moving throughout the three worlds playing on
          the Veena, a gift from God Himself. Whenever Narada merges himself in
          divine love and sings His sport, that very moment He appears before
          him.
        </p>
        <h3>II</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Narada is endowed with the knowledge of all the truths of the Vedas.
          He knows Dharma well. He has perfect knowledge of Itihasas and
          Puranas. He has knowledge of the facts of the previous Kalpa. He is a
          master of music. He is an eloquent speaker. He possesses a direct
          vision of all the regions through his power of Yoga. He creates
          quarrels for the good of the world. He is a great teacher of Devotion.
          He is the very embodiment of devotion.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Narada is one of the wisest among the sages. He is ever engaged in
          austerities. He is a divine ministrel. He is a great ascetic. He rose
          from a low position to the highest spiritual glory through divine
          grace and self-effort. He is a Jnani, Yogi and Bhakta in one.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          He is a knower of Brahman. He is a seer of Vedic Mantras. He is a
          saviour. He is a reformer. He is honoured everywhere. He is a great

          self-control, truthfulness, compassion, firm love for God. He is ever
          doing what is auspicious.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          He is one of the ten spiritual sons of Brahma. He went to Sanatkumara
          for attaining wisdom. He admitted that his vast erudition could not
          remove the burden of sorrow. Therefore Sanatkumara illumined him about
          the Infinite Bliss, Bhuma (vide Chhandogya Upanishad).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Narada is the friend, philosopher, guide and consoler of all-Gods,
          demons and men.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Through the grace of Narada, Dhruva was enthroned permanently in his
          celestial state. Narada takes into his care Hiranya's wife who was
          then carrying Prahlada.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          He advises the demon Andhaka to test the power of Siva's boon on
          himself. He advises Kamsa to slay the children of Devaki. He manages
          to get Ravana entangled on Vali's tail. He goes as a messenger to
          Indra from Sri Krishna to remove his pride by depriving him of the
          Parijata. These incidents reveal the greatness of his character.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Various scriptures name Devarshi Narada as the third Avatara of Lord
          Hari. In the third chapter of Sri mad Bhagavatam which gives the list
          of 22 incarnations, he comes after Purusha and Varaha.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Narada has been a source of noble and valuable inspiration to those
          who have sought him and found him.

        <h3>Narada Inspires Sri Vyasa</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Maharshi Vyasa divided the Vedas into four parts for the benefit of
          the people at large. He composed the Mahabharata. He wrote the 18
          Puranas and yet he was not quite satisfied . He had no peace of mind.
          He went to the bank of the river Saraswati and sat there in a
          reflective mood.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Narada appeared before him and said, "O Maharshi! In your books you
          have not sung the praise of God to the extent you described the other
          aspects of Dharma. You have failed to deal at length the Bhagavata
          Dharma. That is the reason why you are restless now. Now describe the
          Lilas of Sri Krishna for the good of the world. You will enjoy
          everlasting peace." Sri Vyasa at once began to write Bhagavatam.
        </p>
        <h3>Daksha's curse on Narada</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          At the beginning of creation, Daksha procreated 10,000 children
          through his wife Asikni, daughter of Panchajanya, in order to populate
          the whole world. These children of Daksha called Haryasvas went on a
          pilgrimage to Narayanasaras. They wanted to carry out the orders of
          their father. Narada advised them to attain Self-realisation, the
          highest goal of life. They became Sannyasins and never returned to the
          worldly life.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Daksha became very angry. Brahma consoled him. He again procreated
          10,000 children called Sabalasvas. They too went to Narayanasaras.
          They too became absorbed in God and never returned.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Daksha cursed Narada. Narada is ever a wanderer without a permanent
          abode owing to the force of Daksha's curse. He wanders all over the
          world.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Atha means now. It is something used in the sense of sequence. It is a
          word that is used when a subject is begun, to invoke the Divine
          blessing. Sutra means an aphorism or terse saying impregnated with
          deep significance. Just as flowers and pearls are arranged or studded
          on a thread, so also philosophical ideas are studded or spread or
          arranged in the aphorism. Rishis always have expressed their ideas in
          the form of laconic Sutras. That is the beauty in the writings of
          Rishis or seers. That is the sign of God-realisation. The six Darsanas
          or schools of philosophy are embodied in the form of Sutras only.
          Without a commentary it is difficult for laymen to understand these
          Sutras.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Bhakti is defined in the following Sutra. Those who have understood
          the magnitude of human sufferings in this sense-universe and those who
          have realised that this world is unreal, impermanent, illusory,
          perishable, full of troubles, difficulties, miseries, pain, sorrow and
          tribulation and those who desire to free themselves from the round of
          births and deaths with its concomitant evils of old age, diseases,
          etc. , should know what Bhakti is, how to develop Bhakti, who is God
          or Lord or Isvara, the relationship between God and man and the
          methods to realise God, or to approach Him or to attain
          God-Consciousness.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The term Bhakti comes from the root "Bhaj", which means "to be
          attached to God. " Bhajan, worship, Bhakti, Anurag, Prem, Priti are
          synonymous terms. Bhakti is love for love's sake. The devotee wants
          God and God alone. There is no selfish expectation here. There is no
          fear also. Therefore it is called "Parama-prema-rupaa. " Is the son
          afraid of his father, who is a Sessions Judge? Is the wife afraid of
          her husband? So also a devotee entertains not the least fear of God.
          The fear of retribution vanishes in him. He feels, believes, conceives
          and imagines that his Ishtam is an Ocean of Love or Prem.

          Devotion gives Immortality. Bhakti is an embodiment of Amritam or
          nectar. Nitya Sukha (eternal bliss), Immortality, Parama Santi
          (supreme peace), Nitya Tripti (eternal satisfaction), Akhanda Sukha
          (unbroken joy) can be had only in God. That is the reason why
          aspirants attempt for God-realisation. Worldly pleasure is not
          constant. He who smiles and laughs for five minutes weeps bitterly for
          hours together. No man in this world is perfectly happy. A
          multimillionaire is full of cares, worries, anxieties and fear. He is
          afraid of enemies. He is guarded by sepoys. He has to take injections
          for getting sleep, as he is always worried. He is worse than a
          prisoner. Rockefeller, the richest man in the world, who could pave a
          road of several miles with golden sheets expressed to a priest who
          went to behold his glory and opulence: "O reverend priest! I am the
          most miserable man in the world. I can't eat anything; my stomach,
          kidneys and liver are filled with germs and diseases. I am always
          restless". Maitreyi puts a question to her husband: "O my Lord! Can
          the wealth of the three worlds give me immortality?" Yajnavalkya
          replied: "Certainly not, my beloved. " Yama also says to Nachiketas:
          "Wealthy people, on account of delusion and pride, lose their memory,
          intellect and understanding, and go round and round in this
          impermanent and unhappy world and come again and again in my clutches.
          Wealth and woman are my two snares to entrap the worldly-minded
          persons whose minds are filled with lust and greed. You are above
          these things. You have shunned all my temptations. You have selected
          the Sreyo-Marga".
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          This is a world of diversity. Intellects are different. Faces are
          different. Religions are different. Sounds are different. Faiths are
          different. Colours are different. Faculties are different. Tastes and
          temperaments are different. But one thing is common in all. Every one
          of us wants Nitya Sukha (eternal happiness), infinite Knowledge,
          Immortality, freedom and independence. These things can be obtained by
          God-realisation alone.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          These are the fruits of Bhakti. Sutras 4, 5 and 6 describe the fruits
          of Bhakti. All weaknesses and Doshas (faults) vanish. People put a
          question: "How can we love God whom we have not seen?" Remain in the
          company of Bhaktas; hear the Lilas of Bhagavan, His Aisvaryas (Divine
          powers) or Vibhutis, His Madhurya (grace and beauty); serve Bhaktas;
          sing His Name daily and do Japa of His Mantra; stay for one year in
          Ayodhya, Vrindavana, Chitrakuta, Rishikesh or Pandharpur. You will
          develop love for God.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Why does desire manifest? On account of Avidya or ignorance or
          imperfection or lack of bliss. When one gets Darshan of God, all
          desires are burnt up. When the boy Dhruva had Darshan of Lord Hari,
          the desire to obtain kingdom that prompted him to worship,
          disappeared. Devotion is a fire like Jnanagni (fire of wisdom) that
          burns up all mundane desires.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          How can a trace of earthly desire remain when the devotee attains God,
          the embodiment of bliss? Darshan of God comes in various ways viz. ,
          in dreams, in physical form with four hands, with conch, mace, discus
          and lotus-flower in the hands, in the form of cosmic consciousness
          (Visvarupa Darshan) which Arjuna had, in the form of Hiranyagarbha
          consciousness or full knowledge of Brahma- loka, etc. Note how Arjuna
          expresses his experiences of cosmic consciousness: "Nor source, nor
          midst, nor end; infinite force, unnumbered arms, the sun and moon
          Thine eyes; I see Thy face, as sacrificial fire, blazing, its
          splendour burneth up the worlds. " God sometimes gives Darshan to
          encourage His devotees by coming down in Vimana (or celestial car).
          Akasa Vani, dazzling lights in space or sky are some other
          encouragements which God gives to push His devotees on the path
          vigorously and rapidly. The devotee should not stop his Sadhana on
          account of false Tushti (satisfaction) when he gets His Darshan. He
          should ever rest in God. He should have perfect Nishtha in God always
          (Svaroopa-sthiti). He should not leave off his practices till he
          merges himself in the Lord-Maha-Bhava or Tanmaya State (Parama Prem).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The devotee who realises God is freed from grief also. Can darkness
          remain in the presence of light? How can sorrow manifest when one is
          immersed in the Ocean of Bliss and Prem? Grief is a mental creation.
          It manifests when the mind is attached to body and illusory
          connections. When the mind is obliterated, when there is
          Self-absorption and self-effacement by merging in the bosom of God,
          how can grief approach the devotee? Absolutely impossible. The devotee
          does not hate anything. Hatred is due to ignorance. How can the
          devotee hate anybody when he sees Lord Hari in everything? He feels
          that the world is manifestation of the Lord and all movements and
          actions are His Lilas. He has no Ghrina or dislike for faecal matter,
          dirt, Chandala, scavenger, cobbler, beggar, prostitute, thief, etc. He
          says: "I see everywhere my sweet Lord. It is Hari who is playing the
          part of prostitute, thief, dacoit, scavenger". He has an
          all-embracing, all-inclusive, exalted mental state. This cannot be
          adequately described in words. It has to be felt. Mira, Gouranga,
          Hafiz, Tulasi Das, Kabir, Ram Das all enjoyed this state. Tulasi Das
          says: "Shiyaram maya sab jaga jane, karahu pranam jory juge pani-Know
          everything as Siyaram, Sita and Rama, and with folded hands do
          prostrations to all, to everything. "
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          In Purusha Sukta you will find a description of the Purusha: "The
          Purusha has one thousand heads, one thousand eyes, one thousand feet.
          " There is an echo of these ideas in the Gita (XIII-13): "With hands
          and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears
          everywhere, He exists in the worlds enveloping all". Lord Krishna
          gives advice to Uddhava and prescribes an easy way for reaching Him.
          "Know, Uddhava, that Brahmin, Chandala, ass, dog, king, beggar are all
          My forms. When you meet any object, do prostration and feel My
          presence". Nama Dev said to the dog: "O Vittala, my dear in the form
          of dog, do not run away with the dry bread. It will affect your soft
          throat. Pray, let me apply ghee to the bread". He ran with ghee in a
          cup to the dog. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa prostrated before an
          outcaste girl: "O Mother Kaali! I see Thee in this girl. " Pavhari
          Baba prostrated before a thief with a bag of utensils: "O thief
          Narayan! Pray, accept these things, I never knew that thief Narayan
          was in my cottage". Ekanath, a Maharashtra Bhakta gave his ring
          voluntarily to a thief when he entered the house: "O thief! Take this
          ring also. Your kartavya (duty) is to steal the things. Thou art
          Vittala (Krishna). Keep up this Lila. " Have you understood the
          sublime state of these exalted Bhaktas who have a new angle of vision?
          A day will come to you also. Exert. Struggle. Pray. Worship. Meditate.
          Plunge yourself in Bhajan with zeal, earnestness and fervour.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Give up this unquenchable thirst for sensual pleasure, woman, money
          and worldly prosperity which is the greatest obstacle in the path of
          devotion and turn your mind towards God. Here is an inexhaustible and
          imperishable spiritual wealth which no dacoit can rob and a Divine
          Bliss which is not mixed with fear or pain.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          When one is happy in his own Self, then alone he becomes independent.
          If one depends for his happiness on perishable objects, he begins to
          weep when the centre of his pleasure is withdrawn. The husband weeps
          when his wife or son dies, when the bank in which he has deposited his
          money fails. Objects that are conditioned in time, space and causation
          are vinasi, perishable. They cannot give, therefore, eternal happiness
          to human beings. So in the Gita, Bhagavan Sri Krishna says: "The
          enjoyments that are born of contacts are only generators of pain, for
          they have a beginning and an end, O Kaunteya! The wise man does not
          rejoice in them. " (Gita: V-22. ) " That happiness which arises from
          the contact of the sense-organs with the objects, which is at first
          like nectar, and in the end like poison-Agre amritopamam pariname
          vishamiva" (Gita: XVIII-38. ) "With the self unattached to external
          contacts he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in the
          meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness. " (Gita:
          V-21. ) "The man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with
          the Self and who is content in the Self alone, for him verily there is
          nothing to do. " (Gita: III-17. ) Nothing can shake a man who rejoices
          in the Self (Atmarati); who is satisfied in the Self (Atma Tripti);
          and who is contented in the Self (Atma Santoshi); and who plays in the
          Self (Atma Kreeda).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          It is Vasana (subtle desire) that draws a man outside towards external
          objects. Avidya (ignorance) has got two forces, the Avarana or veiling
          power, the Sakti that screens the man from his real Sat-chit-ananda
          Svaroopa behind, and the Vikshepa Sakti that makes the mind and senses
          outgoing. The restlessness of the mind is due to desire and Vikshepa
          Sakti. Avidya clouds the understanding and produces intoxication,
          destroys the intellect and makes the intellect perverted, stony and
          barren. Therefore man always thinks that he can get pleasure in
          external objects, mistakes the body, children and wife as Atman and
          takes the unreal world as real. When lust manifests, the intellect
          becomes blind and the most intelligent man becomes an easy prey to
          passion. A worldly-minded man vainly searches for his happiness in
          outside perishable objects. The idea that he should dive deep into the
          chambers of his heart by collecting all the dissipated rays of the
          mind, and by withdrawing the out-going senses to meditate on God never
          strikes him. He never believes in devotion, concentration and
          meditation. He cannot imagine a pure, unalloyed happiness that is
          independent of external objects, although he enjoys the bliss of the
          Self daily at night. He foolishly thinks: "If I have a bungalow in
          Mussoorie for summer, if I have a car, if I have my own cow for good
          milk, if I have a son, if I have a garden, I will be happy. " The
          tendency of the mind is such that it tries to seek happiness outside
          in perishable objects. This is due to the force of Avidya.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          But the devotee gets the grace of the Lord. His intellect is calm and
          tranquil. All the outgoing energies become transmuted into spiritual
          energy. He gets help and strength from Mantra-Sakti, Sadhana Sakti and
          Upasana Sakti. Sattva flows from the feet of the Lord towards his
          mind. All desires melt away. The Vikshepa Sakti is destroyed. He has
          the firm, unshakable conviction that the real happiness is in God. His
          mind is always inward. He has Antarmukha Vritti. The senses do not
          wander about. They get absorbed in the mind and the mind gets absorbed
          in God. He is ever peaceful. He enjoys the happiness within. He
          delights in the bliss of God. He therefore stands adamantine even
          amidst grave troubles and calamities. So Rishi Narada uses the
          expressions "Stabdho bhavati" (the devotee becomes serene) and
          "Atmaramo bhavati" (happy in the bliss of the Self).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The devotee gets divine intoxication. Lord Gouranga was so much
          intoxicated with the divine nectar of Prem that sometimes he did not
          know when it was daybreak and when it was night. Mira, though a young
          Rani, danced in the streets amidst males and men of inferior class on
          account of this intoxication of Krishna-prem. Sri Ramakrishna
          Paramahamsa remained in the thick jungle for four days without taking
          any food when he was under this divine intoxication. Words can hardly
          describe the nature of this divine intoxication. One has to feel it
          himself. Even if there is a mild intoxication, it will give immense
          strength to the devotee to face the difficulties in the battle of
          life. Therefore Narada says: "matto bhavati. "

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Desire is an enemy of peace. Desire is an enemy of devotion. Without
          renunciation (Tyaga) Bhakti can never be cultivated in the heart.
          Vishaya-asakti (attachment to sensual enjoyments) is the obstacle in
          developing devotion. Energy leaks out. No improvement is seen in
          spiritual Sadhana. The devotee always complains: "I have not realised
          anything in the path of devotion. My mind remains in the same state.
          It always wanders about wildly in the sensual grooves. I am restless.
          What is to be done?" Desire is very powerful. It assumes various
          subtle forms. Desire is Maya's weapon to hurl down the Jivas into the
          mire of Samsara. There is no end for desires. It is unconquerable.
          Enjoyment does not bring satisfaction of a desire. Just as fire is
          increased by pouring ghee over it, so also desire is strengthened by
          Bhoga. Have you not studied the life of Raja Yayati in Mahabharata? He
          borrowed the youthful state from his son and enjoyed for thousands of
          years and cried out in the end: "Alas! My passion has not gone. There
          is no satiety. My heart is still burning with lust. " Bhartrihari
          weeps bitterly: "I have renounced the world, wife and kingdom. I live
          on leaves and water. I do penance. Yet lust is troubling me. " Such is
          the potency of desire.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          That is the reason why Lord Krishna says in the Gita (III-39, 40, 41,
          43 & II-55): "Enveloped is wisdom by this constant enemy of the wise
          in the form of desire, which is insatiable as a flame. The senses, the
          mind and the reason are said to be its seat; by these, enveloping
          wisdom, it bewilders the dweller in the body. Therefore, O best of the
          Bharatas, mastering first the senses do thou slay this thing of sin,
          destructive of wisdom and knowledge. Thus understanding Him as greater
          than the Reason, restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O
          mighty-armed, the enemy in the form of desire, difficult to overcome.
          When a man abandoneth, O Partha, all the desires of the heart, and is
          satisfied in the Self, by the Self, then is he called stable in mind.
          "

          First annihilate Asakti; then the Kamana (longing) will die by itself.
          Eventually preference also will be destroyed. When the attraction
          towards external objects ceases, then there yet remains the internal
          craving which is called Trishna (thirsting for objects). This is the
          most dangerous enemy of devotion. When the attraction towards objects,
          external as well as internal, ceases without any veil, then it is
          termed Mukta (free from) Trishna. The mere thought of longing that
          such and such a thing should come to oneself is Trishna. It is this
          strong chain of Trishna that you should unshackle yourself from, if
          you want to grow in Bhakti. Cut off the Trishna-Tantu (the thread of
          sense-hankering) by the sword of Vairagya. This is "Nirodha" or
          control of desire.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          A worldly-minded man cannot work without expectation of fruits of his
          works. He reaps the fruits by going to heaven. He comes back again to
          this Mrityu-loka when the virtuous works are exhausted. He again does
          good and evil Karmas. Thus he is caught up in the never-ending wheel
          of Samsara or Avagamana-Chakra. Rishis, Seers and the Vedas therefore
          advise that the works should be performed without expectation of
          fruits and should be consecrated to the Lord as Isvararpana. Then the
          heart is purified and Bhakti develops. That is the reason why Lord
          Krishna advises Arjuna: "Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest,
          whatsoever thou offerest, whatsoever thou givest, whatsoever thou
          doest of austerity, O Kaunteya! do thou that as an offering unto Me. "
          (Gita: IX-27. ) Patanjali Maharshi, the exponent of Raja Yoga
          philosophy, also says: "Ishvara-pranidhanadva-Success is speedy in
          Yogic practice and attainment of Samadhi by surrendering the fruits of
          works at the feet of the Lord as an offering. " Ishvara-pranidhana is
          an important item in his Kriya-Yoga and Niyama.

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Egoism, ambition and Vasanas are obstacles in the way of
          self-surrender. Subtle hidden Vasanas will try to come to the surface
          of the mind. Desires, which are suppressed for some time, will again
          manifest with redoubled force, if the aspirant is not careful, if
          there is some waning in his Vairagya and spiritual practice, and if he
          mixes with worldly-minded people. Generally the aspirant consciously
          or unconsciously, wittingly or unwittingly keeps up some desires for
          his gratification. He does not wish to part completely with his
          desires. Therefore the self-surrender does not become perfect and
          unreserved. So the grace of the Lord does not descend. Even if there
          is an atom of desire or egoism, there is no possibility of Divine
          Grace. Mira says: "I have given up my mind, my heart, my soul, my
          Chitta, my intellect, my all to my beloved Giridhar Gopal. " This is
          complete self-surrender. Mark the word 'my all'. The Lord becomes a
          slave of a Bhakta only when he has made absolute, ungrudging,
          self-surrender. He is very cruel and puts His devotee to severe tests
          and trials. Only when Surdas poked his eyes with the thorns and
          remained without food and water in the thick jungle, Lord Krishna
          appeared before him with sweetmeats and water. He did not hear the
          words of Draupadi, so long as she kept up her own strength and traces
          of egoism. When she cried aloud with perfect sincerity and total
          resignation: "O Dwarakanath, O my beloved! Come to my rescue. " Then
          He ran to the scene, she had abundant clothes, and her modesty was
          saved. Nyasa means renunciation. This brings Nirodha (control) of
          mind. It is renunciation of the fruits of works. Renunciation of
          egoism is Sarva-Tyaga (renunciation of all). All desires, selfishness,
          Raga, Dvesha, body-idea, Deha-abhimana, are hanging on egoism. Egoism
          is the pivot on which all these are centred. Kill egoism. Then the
          surrender becomes complete. Even if there is a tinge or grain of
          egoism, the Lord will not reveal Himself.

        </div>
        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          "Ananyata" is single-minded devotion unto the Lord. The child thinks
          of the mother and mother alone. A passionate husband thinks of his
          wife and wife alone. A greedy money-lender thinks of his money and
          money alone. Even so the devotee should entertain in his heart the
          picture of his Ishtam and Ishtam alone. Then he can have Darshan of
          God easily. Lord Krishna says to Arjuna: "I am easily attainable by
          that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me (for a
          long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single mind or
          one-pointed mind), O Partha! " (Gita: VIII-14. )
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The single-minded devotion can only manifest by constant and
          protracted practice in a quiet room, and Vairagya. Whenever the
          wavering and unsteady mind runs out, curb it, draw it and fix it again
          and again at the face or lotus feet of the Lord. It takes some time
          for the collection of scattered rays of the mind, and for establishing
          new habits in the mind. One should not be discouraged in the
          beginning. Patience, perseverance, attention, faith, strong will,
          fortitude, power of endurance are needed. These virtues should be
          cultivated. Satsanga, dietetic adjustment, milk and fruits, fasting,
          control of sleep, reduction in the hours of sleep, sometimes
          seclusion, observance of Mauna, Brahmacharya should be resorted to.
          The mind is naturally prone to love of ease, gluttony, laziness,
          seeking of comforts, gossiping, worldly talks, sight seeing etc. It
          should be gradually trained, tamed and disciplined by suitable
          methods. It is like a spoiled, indulgent child. It must be sometimes
          coaxed, while at other times, if it is unruly and disobedient, it must
          be threatened and whipped. Fasting is whipping. Mauna is whipping.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Udaseenata is indifference to sensual enjoyments and sensual objects.
          Objects are enemies of God. Sons, wife, property, cattle, house,
          friends, relatives are the enemies of God. You must cherish perfect
          indifference to these objects. You must destroy ruthlessly Moha for
          these objects and develop the state of Nirabhimanata (without
          'mine-ness'). Moha is infatuated love towards body, children, father,
          mother and wife. Attachment to the body is deep-rooted. You must not
          think of the body and its wants too much. Thoughts of body, thoughts
          of food, thoughts of wife and children make you forget God. You cannot
          have thoughts of God if you have thoughts of Anatma things
          (non-sentient objects).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          There is supreme joy and bliss in Udaseenata. You will find in the
          Mundaka Upanishad: "Two birds, inseparable companions, dwell upon one
          and the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit; the other looks
          on without eating. On the same tree, the Jiva immersed in worldliness
          and bewildered grieves on account of helplessness. But when he sees
          the other, the Lord, who is adored by all, and His glory, then his
          grief passes away. " Here one bird is the Jiva, the other bird is the
          Lord. The tree is this body. Udaseenata destroys all sorts of
          attachments and desires. Attachment is death. Udaseenata is eternal
          life. Lord Krishna says: "An Udaseena (indifferent man) is dear to Me.
          " (Gita: XII-16. ) Just as the spectators of a cricket or football
          match enjoy the game nicely, so also an Udaseena who is quite
          unconcerned with the world enjoys as a witness of this world-drama and
          passes beyond grief. In the Gita (XIII-9) you will find:
          "Unattachment, absence of self-identification with son, wife or home
          and constant balance of mind in wished for and unwished for
          events-this is declared to be the Wisdom. "
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Remember, dear readers! that Udaseenata is not physical nudity. It is
          not the living on Neem leaves or cow's dung or groundnut. Performance
          of foolish kinds of austerities (Moodha Tapas) does not constitute
          Udaseenata. Lord Krishna says (Gita: XVII-5, 6): "Those men who
          practise terrific austerities not enjoined by the scriptures, given to
          hypocrisy and egoism, impelled by the force of lust and attachment,
          senseless, torturing all the elements in the body and Me also, Who
          dwell in the body, -know thou these to be of demoniacal resolves. "
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Udaseenata is purely a mental state. Queen Chudala was a perfect
          Udaseena though she reigned over a dominion; but her husband was
          attached to his begging bowl and walking-stick though he lived in a
          forest. A man may be attached to his Kowpeen or a fountain-pen even,
          whereas a king like Janaka may be a perfect Udaseena though he is
          amidst luxuries and opulence. Worldly people attach much importance to
          external show only. This is a great pity. This is their horrible
          mistake. A man may be nude and yet his mind may be full of desires.
          Some hypocrites pretend to be Virakta Sadhus to exploit the
          householders. Householders should use their discrimination always.
          Udaseena Vritti comes from Mithya Drishti and Dosha Drishti in objects
          and from discrimination between the real and the unreal.

          pleasure-centres should be destroyed. Then alone the mind can be
          turned towards God with one-pointed concentration. The mind is always
          jumping like a monkey. Now it thinks of sweetmeats or fruits. Then it
          thinks of cinema-show for feasting the eyes. Then it wants to hear
          some melodious music. Then it wants to talk something with some
          friends. Just as a Chinaman is drawn hither and thither by his five
          wives, so also the mind is tossed hither and thither by the five
          Indriyas. It is always restless.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Through Vairagya and discrimination all these pleasure- centres should
          be destroyed. Then through constant, steady Abhyasa of Japa and
          Dhyana, it should be turned towards God. The struggle is doubtless,
          keen and hard. How difficult it will be to send up the waters of the
          Ganga above towards Badri Narayan! Still more difficult it will be for
          taking the mental energy towards God. It is easy to direct the mental
          energy towards sensual objects. It is but natural. It is the nature of
          the mind to run by itself towards objects without the least exertion.
          It is its Svabhava. Lord Krishna says: "With the mind not moving
          towards any other thing, made steadfast by the method of habitual
          meditation, and constantly meditating, one goes to the Supreme Person,
          the Resplendent, O Partha. " (Gita: VIII-8. ) "Fix thy mind on Me
          only, thy intellect in Me, (then) thou shalt no doubt live in Me alone
          hereafter. If thou art unable to fix thy mind steadily on Me, then by
          the Yoga of constant practice (Abhyasa Yoga) do thou seek to reach Me,
          O Dhananjaya. " (Gita: XII-8, 9. ) In the practice of concentration
          one should have the same patience and perseverance as that of the bird
          which tried to empty the ocean with its beak or blade of grass. Arjuna
          aimed at the bird above by seeing the reflection of the bird in the
          water. The arrow-maker was so much absorbed in his work that he did
          not notice the huge crowd of the Raja and his retinue. Such must be
          the nature of concentration on God in the Adhyatmic battlefield. Just
          as the bird that is tied to a post flutters about hither and thither
          and eventually rests on the post, so also the mind that wanders about
          here and there in sensual objects finally rests in God, through the
          practice of one-pointed concentration and devotion.

          Lord Krishna says: "If also thou art not equal to constant practice,
          be intent on My service; performing actions for My sake, thou shalt
          attain perfection. " (XII-10. ) "Acts of sacrifice, gift and charity
          should not be relinquished, but should be performed; sacrifice, gift,
          and also austerity are the purifiers of the intelligence. " (XVIII-5.
          )
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          These rituals purify the heart and prepare the ground of Antahkarana
          for the growth of devotion. These actions should be performed without
          attachment and without expectation of fruit. The sacrifice which is
          offered by men without desire for fruit as enjoined by the ordinances,
          under the firm belief that sacrifice is a duty, that is pure. The
          three kinds of austerity viz. , physical, verbal, and mental Tapas
          prescribed in the Seventeenth Chapter of the Gita purify the heart
          rapidly. They are:
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          1. <strong>Physical</strong>: Worship given to the gods, to the
          twice-born, to the teachers and to the wise, purity,
          straight-forwardness, continence and harmlessness, are called the
          austerity of the body.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          2. <strong>Verbal</strong>: Speech causing no annoyance, truthful and
          beneficial, the practice of the study of the scriptures are called the
          austerity of speech.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          3. <strong>Mental</strong>: Mental happiness, equilibrium, silence,
          self-control, purity of nature, this is called the austerity of the
          mind.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          This threefold austerity, performed by men with the utmost faith,
          without desire for fruit, harmonised, is said to be pure.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Without purification of the mind, there is no hope of cultivating
          Bhakti in the heart.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Agnihotra, Vaisvadeva, Brahma Yajna, Sandhyavandana in the three
          periods of time, Pancha Maha Yajnas-all are best calculated to purify
          the Chitta. They should be performed daily without any break.
          Observance of Chandrayana Vrata and Krichhra Vrata destroy sins
          effectively. They serve the purpose of Prayaschitta for expiating sin.
          The more the mind-mirror is cleansed, the better it is. Though these
          ceremonies are not necessary for an advanced Bhakta, yet they are very
          essential for neophytes.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Sraddha, Tarpan, observances and gifts on the occasion of eclipses
          should not be neglected. Consult the code of Manu or Yajnavalkya
          Smriti and you will get abundant information on this subject. Various
          kinds of Prayaschitta destroy various kinds of sin. If you find it
          difficult to consult the scriptures, consult Pundits and Acharyas and
          they will guide you. If you do not observe these rituals, you will be
          subject to Pratyavaya Dosha, the sin of omission. Jaimini lays great
          stress on Karmas (Agnihotra etc. )
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Pradosha Vrata, Ekadasi Vrata are observances that propitiate Lord
          Siva and Lord Hari respectively. They should also be observed rigidly.

          That is the reason why Lord Krishna says: "The ignorant, the
          faithless, the doubting self goes to destruction; there is neither
          this world nor the other, nor happiness for the doubting self. "
          (Gita: IV-40. ) "Therefore, let the scriptures be the authority in
          determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done.
          Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou

          The mind should not be allowed to have its own ways. He who follows
          the injunctions of the Sastras will evolve quickly. He will have no
          uneasiness in mind. He will have satisfaction. He will feel that he is
          in the right path and progressing rapidly in spirituality. He will
          feel the nearness of God. He will have peace of mind.

          Scriptures are infallible. Vedas have come out from the mouth of God.
          They are revelations. They are traditionally handed down from Rishis
          and seers to their disciples in succession (Parampara). So long as
          there is world, there are scriptures and teachers to guide the people
          in the path of Truth and Righteousness. The number of teachers may be
          few in the iron age but they do exist. Books are not eternal. But the
          ideas in the Vedas are eternal.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          It does not require much wisdom and reasoning to have a firm
          conviction in the existence of God. I do not know why these
          rationalists, socialists and materialistic scientists are
          unnecessarily racking their brains, fighting and doubting. It is
          really a great pity! It is their stiff egoism that makes them deny the
          existence of God. Whether they accept His existence or not, He is
          shining from eternity to eternity. The sun is always there whether the
          owls accept the existence of the sun or not. There are gross
          impurities in their minds which screen and cloud their understanding.
          There are sins in their Antahkarana which make their intellects
          perverted. They will have to wait for some time for grasping the
          Truth.

          Just as a young plant is fenced in the beginning and protected, so
          also a neophyte in the path of devotion should be well-protected. If
          he mixes with atheists, he will lose his faith in God quickly. He must
          be always in the company of Sadhus, Mahatmas and Bhaktas. Their
          company is an iron fortress for him. If the injunctions of the Sastras
          are rigidly followed, nothing can shake one's convictions. Just as a
          nail is driven deep into a plank by frequent hammerings, so also the
          Samskaras and convictions become very deep by observing strictly the
          sacred laws of the scriptures. This is the meaning of this Sutra.

          Maya is very powerful. Mysterious is the power of Moha and desire!
          That is the reason why Lord Krishna says (Gita: II-60 & 67): "The
          turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do violently carry away the mind of a wise
          man, though he be striving. For the mind, which follows in the wake of
          the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, as the wind
          (carries away) a boat on the waters. "

          You are all aware how the Rishi Vishwamitra of great Tapas became a
          victim of the influence of the celestial nymph. Even Lord Buddha had
          to face Mara. This world is full of temptations. There is fear of fall
          at every moment. A beginner, a tyro is unable to resist temptation. He
          falls a prey to its influence quite readily. The Sadhaka must be very,
          very careful. He should observe the injunctions of the Sastras. They
          pave a long way in keeping him from falling. He should not test his
          spiritual strength at the very outset when he had made a little
          progress only. Reaction may set in. The Indriyas will revolt. The mind
          will become furious. He will become a victim to passion. Even at the
          present moment, such instances of Yoga-Bhrashtas are not lacking. When
          one is put to test he fails. Jaimini was tried by his Guru, Sri
          Vedavyasa. He failed in his Brahmacharya. Physical control alone will
          not suffice. No evil thoughts should arise in the mind. There must not
          be any unholy thrill or unholy vibration in the mind even. This is the
          highest standard of purity. The Gita (III-6) says: "He who,
          restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects
          in mind, he of deluded understanding is called a hypocrite. "

          Some foolish young Sadhakas do some Sadhana for four or five years in
          Himalayan caves, see some dazzling lights during meditation, hear some
          Anahata sounds in the ears and think they are realised souls. They
          enter the world quickly for preaching, and mix with the householders
          freely and get hopeless downfall rapidly. What you have gained by
          rigid Sadhana in twelve years, will be lost in twelve seconds if you
          mix promiscuously with householders and if you do not take proper
          precautions. You should never come out to the plains till you attain
          Bhuma or Brahmi-Sthiti, till you become a full-blown Yogi or Jnani.

          The customary injunctions also should be followed like the scriptural
          injunctions. They are also helpful to the aspirant in the beginning.
          When he is fully established in supreme devotion and piety, he can
          safely dispense with the scriptural, as well as, customary
          injunctions. They will drop themselves when he advances in purity and
          devotion. But on the contrary, eating and drinking will continue as
          long as he lives.

          Lakshana means mark, characteristic, or sign. All devotees unanimously
          agree in the essential characteristics of devotion. But some give
          prominence to certain indications, while others to certain other
          marks. That is all. There cannot be any fundamental difference in the
          essence. Nanamatabhedat means according to various opinions.

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Puja is worship of God. Anuraga is intense attachment. Prahlada says:
          "O Hari! May not the ceaseless flow of love and attachment leave my
          heart, while I am constantly meditating upon Thee. " (Vishnu Purana
          I-20-19. ) Devotion cometh and goeth in the beginning. When it is
          fully ripe, the devotee has intense attachment to the lotus-feet of
          the Lord. Even for the infinitesimal part of a second his mind does
          not stir from the point or Lakshya: This is Anuraga.

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Here is a difference of opinion. It is the hearing of praises and
          greatness of the Lord that inspires a man to take to the spiritual
          path. Parikshit realised God through hearing Srimad Bhagavata from the
          sacred mouth of Sri Suka Dev. Man gets several knocks and blows in the
          daily battle of life. He gets failures and disappointments. This world
          becomes a hot furnace to him. He approaches the Bhagavatas and hears
          the praises of God. Then the mind gradually is turned towards God. The
          mind of the rogue Ratnakar was turned towards God after meeting
          Narada.

        <p class="lesson-text">
          God is an embodiment of Bliss. The devotee who always dwells in God
          must enjoy the Bliss of God. There is always divine aura and bloom in
          his face. The eyes sparkle and glitter with Divine effulgence. Those
          who surround the devotee experience the bliss, because he radiates joy
          all around (vide Sutra 6). If a devotee is always morose and unhappy,
          if his countenance is cheerless, if he is peevish, there is surely
          some error in his Sadhana. He is not enjoying the Bliss of the Self.
          Ananda is a very important sign of devotion. It is a fundamental sign
          of a Jivanmukta too.

          The devotee gets parama-vyakulata when he forgets his Beloved. Lord
          Gouranga, Mira and the Gopis of Vrindavana exhibited this sign. This
          is Viraha-agni (pain from separation of the Lord). This feeling can
          hardly be described in words. It has to be felt. It breaks the heart
          of the devotee. This Sutra does not in any way contradict Sutra 18. An
          advanced Bhakta who always rests in God has no Viraha. He is always in
          divine bliss.
