        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Atha means now. It is something used in the sense of sequence. It is a
          word that is used when a subject is begun, to invoke the Divine
          blessing. Sutra means an aphorism or terse saying impregnated with
          deep significance. Just as flowers and pearls are arranged or studded
          on a thread, so also philosophical ideas are studded or spread or
          arranged in the aphorism. Rishis always have expressed their ideas in
          the form of laconic Sutras. That is the beauty in the writings of
          Rishis or seers. That is the sign of God-realisation. The six Darsanas
          or schools of philosophy are embodied in the form of Sutras only.
          Without a commentary it is difficult for laymen to understand these
          Sutras.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Bhakti is defined in the following Sutra. Those who have understood
          the magnitude of human sufferings in this sense-universe and those who
          have realised that this world is unreal, impermanent, illusory,
          perishable, full of troubles, difficulties, miseries, pain, sorrow and
          tribulation and those who desire to free themselves from the round of
          births and deaths with its concomitant evils of old age, diseases,
          etc. , should know what Bhakti is, how to develop Bhakti, who is God
          or Lord or Isvara, the relationship between God and man and the
          methods to realise God, or to approach Him or to attain
          God-Consciousness.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The term Bhakti comes from the root "Bhaj", which means "to be
          attached to God. " Bhajan, worship, Bhakti, Anurag, Prem, Priti are
          synonymous terms. Bhakti is love for love's sake. The devotee wants
          God and God alone. There is no selfish expectation here. There is no
          fear also. Therefore it is called "Parama-prema-rupaa. " Is the son
          afraid of his father, who is a Sessions Judge? Is the wife afraid of
          her husband? So also a devotee entertains not the least fear of God.
          The fear of retribution vanishes in him. He feels, believes, conceives
          and imagines that his Ishtam is an Ocean of Love or Prem.

          Devotion gives Immortality. Bhakti is an embodiment of Amritam or
          nectar. Nitya Sukha (eternal bliss), Immortality, Parama Santi
          (supreme peace), Nitya Tripti (eternal satisfaction), Akhanda Sukha
          (unbroken joy) can be had only in God. That is the reason why
          aspirants attempt for God-realisation. Worldly pleasure is not
          constant. He who smiles and laughs for five minutes weeps bitterly for
          hours together. No man in this world is perfectly happy. A
          multimillionaire is full of cares, worries, anxieties and fear. He is
          afraid of enemies. He is guarded by sepoys. He has to take injections
          for getting sleep, as he is always worried. He is worse than a
          prisoner. Rockefeller, the richest man in the world, who could pave a
          road of several miles with golden sheets expressed to a priest who
          went to behold his glory and opulence: "O reverend priest! I am the
          most miserable man in the world. I can't eat anything; my stomach,
          kidneys and liver are filled with germs and diseases. I am always
          restless". Maitreyi puts a question to her husband: "O my Lord! Can
          the wealth of the three worlds give me immortality?" Yajnavalkya
          replied: "Certainly not, my beloved. " Yama also says to Nachiketas:
          "Wealthy people, on account of delusion and pride, lose their memory,
          intellect and understanding, and go round and round in this
          impermanent and unhappy world and come again and again in my clutches.
          Wealth and woman are my two snares to entrap the worldly-minded
          persons whose minds are filled with lust and greed. You are above
          these things. You have shunned all my temptations. You have selected
          the Sreyo-Marga".
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          This is a world of diversity. Intellects are different. Faces are
          different. Religions are different. Sounds are different. Faiths are
          different. Colours are different. Faculties are different. Tastes and
          temperaments are different. But one thing is common in all. Every one
          of us wants Nitya Sukha (eternal happiness), infinite Knowledge,
          Immortality, freedom and independence. These things can be obtained by
          God-realisation alone.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          These are the fruits of Bhakti. Sutras 4, 5 and 6 describe the fruits
          of Bhakti. All weaknesses and Doshas (faults) vanish. People put a
          question: "How can we love God whom we have not seen?" Remain in the
          company of Bhaktas; hear the Lilas of Bhagavan, His Aisvaryas (Divine
          powers) or Vibhutis, His Madhurya (grace and beauty); serve Bhaktas;
          sing His Name daily and do Japa of His Mantra; stay for one year in
          Ayodhya, Vrindavana, Chitrakuta, Rishikesh or Pandharpur. You will
          develop love for God.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Why does desire manifest? On account of Avidya or ignorance or
          imperfection or lack of bliss. When one gets Darshan of God, all
          desires are burnt up. When the boy Dhruva had Darshan of Lord Hari,
          the desire to obtain kingdom that prompted him to worship,
          disappeared. Devotion is a fire like Jnanagni (fire of wisdom) that
          burns up all mundane desires.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          How can a trace of earthly desire remain when the devotee attains God,
          the embodiment of bliss? Darshan of God comes in various ways viz. ,
          in dreams, in physical form with four hands, with conch, mace, discus
          and lotus-flower in the hands, in the form of cosmic consciousness
          (Visvarupa Darshan) which Arjuna had, in the form of Hiranyagarbha
          consciousness or full knowledge of Brahma- loka, etc. Note how Arjuna
          expresses his experiences of cosmic consciousness: "Nor source, nor
          midst, nor end; infinite force, unnumbered arms, the sun and moon
          Thine eyes; I see Thy face, as sacrificial fire, blazing, its
          splendour burneth up the worlds. " God sometimes gives Darshan to
          encourage His devotees by coming down in Vimana (or celestial car).
          Akasa Vani, dazzling lights in space or sky are some other
          encouragements which God gives to push His devotees on the path
          vigorously and rapidly. The devotee should not stop his Sadhana on
          account of false Tushti (satisfaction) when he gets His Darshan. He
          should ever rest in God. He should have perfect Nishtha in God always
          (Svaroopa-sthiti). He should not leave off his practices till he
          merges himself in the Lord-Maha-Bhava or Tanmaya State (Parama Prem).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The devotee who realises God is freed from grief also. Can darkness
          remain in the presence of light? How can sorrow manifest when one is
          immersed in the Ocean of Bliss and Prem? Grief is a mental creation.
          It manifests when the mind is attached to body and illusory
          connections. When the mind is obliterated, when there is
          Self-absorption and self-effacement by merging in the bosom of God,
          how can grief approach the devotee? Absolutely impossible. The devotee
          does not hate anything. Hatred is due to ignorance. How can the
          devotee hate anybody when he sees Lord Hari in everything? He feels
          that the world is manifestation of the Lord and all movements and
          actions are His Lilas. He has no Ghrina or dislike for faecal matter,
          dirt, Chandala, scavenger, cobbler, beggar, prostitute, thief, etc. He
          says: "I see everywhere my sweet Lord. It is Hari who is playing the
          part of prostitute, thief, dacoit, scavenger". He has an
          all-embracing, all-inclusive, exalted mental state. This cannot be
          adequately described in words. It has to be felt. Mira, Gouranga,
          Hafiz, Tulasi Das, Kabir, Ram Das all enjoyed this state. Tulasi Das
          says: "Shiyaram maya sab jaga jane, karahu pranam jory juge pani-Know
          everything as Siyaram, Sita and Rama, and with folded hands do
          prostrations to all, to everything. "

        <p class="lesson-text">
          In Purusha Sukta you will find a description of the Purusha: "The
          Purusha has one thousand heads, one thousand eyes, one thousand feet.
          " There is an echo of these ideas in the Gita (XIII-13): "With hands
          and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears
          everywhere, He exists in the worlds enveloping all". Lord Krishna
          gives advice to Uddhava and prescribes an easy way for reaching Him.
          "Know, Uddhava, that Brahmin, Chandala, ass, dog, king, beggar are all
          My forms. When you meet any object, do prostration and feel My
          presence". Nama Dev said to the dog: "O Vittala, my dear in the form
          of dog, do not run away with the dry bread. It will affect your soft
          throat. Pray, let me apply ghee to the bread". He ran with ghee in a
          cup to the dog. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa prostrated before an
          outcaste girl: "O Mother Kaali! I see Thee in this girl. " Pavhari
          Baba prostrated before a thief with a bag of utensils: "O thief
          Narayan! Pray, accept these things, I never knew that thief Narayan
          was in my cottage". Ekanath, a Maharashtra Bhakta gave his ring
          voluntarily to a thief when he entered the house: "O thief! Take this
          ring also. Your kartavya (duty) is to steal the things. Thou art
          Vittala (Krishna). Keep up this Lila. " Have you understood the
          sublime state of these exalted Bhaktas who have a new angle of vision?
          A day will come to you also. Exert. Struggle. Pray. Worship. Meditate.
          Plunge yourself in Bhajan with zeal, earnestness and fervour.

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Give up this unquenchable thirst for sensual pleasure, woman, money
          and worldly prosperity which is the greatest obstacle in the path of
          devotion and turn your mind towards God. Here is an inexhaustible and
          imperishable spiritual wealth which no dacoit can rob and a Divine
          Bliss which is not mixed with fear or pain.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          When one is happy in his own Self, then alone he becomes independent.
          If one depends for his happiness on perishable objects, he begins to
          weep when the centre of his pleasure is withdrawn. The husband weeps
          when his wife or son dies, when the bank in which he has deposited his
          money fails. Objects that are conditioned in time, space and causation
          are vinasi, perishable. They cannot give, therefore, eternal happiness
          to human beings. So in the Gita, Bhagavan Sri Krishna says: "The
          enjoyments that are born of contacts are only generators of pain, for
          they have a beginning and an end, O Kaunteya! The wise man does not
          rejoice in them. " (Gita: V-22. ) " That happiness which arises from
          the contact of the sense-organs with the objects, which is at first
          like nectar, and in the end like poison-Agre amritopamam pariname
          vishamiva" (Gita: XVIII-38. ) "With the self unattached to external
          contacts he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in the
          meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness. " (Gita:
          V-21. ) "The man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with
          the Self and who is content in the Self alone, for him verily there is
          nothing to do. " (Gita: III-17. ) Nothing can shake a man who rejoices
          in the Self (Atmarati); who is satisfied in the Self (Atma Tripti);
          and who is contented in the Self (Atma Santoshi); and who plays in the
          Self (Atma Kreeda).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          It is Vasana (subtle desire) that draws a man outside towards external
          objects. Avidya (ignorance) has got two forces, the Avarana or veiling
          power, the Sakti that screens the man from his real Sat-chit-ananda
          Svaroopa behind, and the Vikshepa Sakti that makes the mind and senses
          outgoing. The restlessness of the mind is due to desire and Vikshepa
          Sakti. Avidya clouds the understanding and produces intoxication,
          destroys the intellect and makes the intellect perverted, stony and
          barren. Therefore man always thinks that he can get pleasure in
          external objects, mistakes the body, children and wife as Atman and
          takes the unreal world as real. When lust manifests, the intellect
          becomes blind and the most intelligent man becomes an easy prey to
          passion. A worldly-minded man vainly searches for his happiness in
          outside perishable objects. The idea that he should dive deep into the
          chambers of his heart by collecting all the dissipated rays of the
          mind, and by withdrawing the out-going senses to meditate on God never
          strikes him. He never believes in devotion, concentration and
          meditation. He cannot imagine a pure, unalloyed happiness that is
          independent of external objects, although he enjoys the bliss of the
          Self daily at night. He foolishly thinks: "If I have a bungalow in
          Mussoorie for summer, if I have a car, if I have my own cow for good
          milk, if I have a son, if I have a garden, I will be happy. " The
          tendency of the mind is such that it tries to seek happiness outside
          in perishable objects. This is due to the force of Avidya.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          But the devotee gets the grace of the Lord. His intellect is calm and
          tranquil. All the outgoing energies become transmuted into spiritual
          energy. He gets help and strength from Mantra-Sakti, Sadhana Sakti and
          Upasana Sakti. Sattva flows from the feet of the Lord towards his
          mind. All desires melt away. The Vikshepa Sakti is destroyed. He has
          the firm, unshakable conviction that the real happiness is in God. His
          mind is always inward. He has Antarmukha Vritti. The senses do not
          wander about. They get absorbed in the mind and the mind gets absorbed
          in God. He is ever peaceful. He enjoys the happiness within. He
          delights in the bliss of God. He therefore stands adamantine even
          amidst grave troubles and calamities. So Rishi Narada uses the
          expressions "Stabdho bhavati" (the devotee becomes serene) and
          "Atmaramo bhavati" (happy in the bliss of the Self).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The devotee gets divine intoxication. Lord Gouranga was so much
          intoxicated with the divine nectar of Prem that sometimes he did not
          know when it was daybreak and when it was night. Mira, though a young
          Rani, danced in the streets amidst males and men of inferior class on
          account of this intoxication of Krishna-prem. Sri Ramakrishna
          Paramahamsa remained in the thick jungle for four days without taking
          any food when he was under this divine intoxication. Words can hardly
          describe the nature of this divine intoxication. One has to feel it
          himself. Even if there is a mild intoxication, it will give immense
          strength to the devotee to face the difficulties in the battle of
          life. Therefore Narada says: "matto bhavati. "

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Desire is an enemy of peace. Desire is an enemy of devotion. Without
          renunciation (Tyaga) Bhakti can never be cultivated in the heart.
          Vishaya-asakti (attachment to sensual enjoyments) is the obstacle in
          developing devotion. Energy leaks out. No improvement is seen in
          spiritual Sadhana. The devotee always complains: "I have not realised
          anything in the path of devotion. My mind remains in the same state.
          It always wanders about wildly in the sensual grooves. I am restless.
          What is to be done?" Desire is very powerful. It assumes various
          subtle forms. Desire is Maya's weapon to hurl down the Jivas into the
          mire of Samsara. There is no end for desires. It is unconquerable.
          Enjoyment does not bring satisfaction of a desire. Just as fire is
          increased by pouring ghee over it, so also desire is strengthened by
          Bhoga. Have you not studied the life of Raja Yayati in Mahabharata? He
          borrowed the youthful state from his son and enjoyed for thousands of
          years and cried out in the end: "Alas! My passion has not gone. There
          is no satiety. My heart is still burning with lust. " Bhartrihari
          weeps bitterly: "I have renounced the world, wife and kingdom. I live
          on leaves and water. I do penance. Yet lust is troubling me. " Such is
          the potency of desire.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          That is the reason why Lord Krishna says in the Gita (III-39, 40, 41,
          43 & II-55): "Enveloped is wisdom by this constant enemy of the wise
          in the form of desire, which is insatiable as a flame. The senses, the
          mind and the reason are said to be its seat; by these, enveloping
          wisdom, it bewilders the dweller in the body. Therefore, O best of the
          Bharatas, mastering first the senses do thou slay this thing of sin,
          destructive of wisdom and knowledge. Thus understanding Him as greater
          than the Reason, restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O
          mighty-armed, the enemy in the form of desire, difficult to overcome.
          When a man abandoneth, O Partha, all the desires of the heart, and is
          satisfied in the Self, by the Self, then is he called stable in mind.
          "

          First annihilate Asakti; then the Kamana (longing) will die by itself.
          Eventually preference also will be destroyed. When the attraction
          towards external objects ceases, then there yet remains the internal
          craving which is called Trishna (thirsting for objects). This is the
          most dangerous enemy of devotion. When the attraction towards objects,
          external as well as internal, ceases without any veil, then it is
          termed Mukta (free from) Trishna. The mere thought of longing that
          such and such a thing should come to oneself is Trishna. It is this
          strong chain of Trishna that you should unshackle yourself from, if
          you want to grow in Bhakti. Cut off the Trishna-Tantu (the thread of
          sense-hankering) by the sword of Vairagya. This is "Nirodha" or
          control of desire.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          A worldly-minded man cannot work without expectation of fruits of his
          works. He reaps the fruits by going to heaven. He comes back again to
          this Mrityu-loka when the virtuous works are exhausted. He again does
          good and evil Karmas. Thus he is caught up in the never-ending wheel
          of Samsara or Avagamana-Chakra. Rishis, Seers and the Vedas therefore
          advise that the works should be performed without expectation of
          fruits and should be consecrated to the Lord as Isvararpana. Then the
          heart is purified and Bhakti develops. That is the reason why Lord
          Krishna advises Arjuna: "Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest,
          whatsoever thou offerest, whatsoever thou givest, whatsoever thou
          doest of austerity, O Kaunteya! do thou that as an offering unto Me. "
          (Gita: IX-27. ) Patanjali Maharshi, the exponent of Raja Yoga
          philosophy, also says: "Ishvara-pranidhanadva-Success is speedy in
          Yogic practice and attainment of Samadhi by surrendering the fruits of
          works at the feet of the Lord as an offering. " Ishvara-pranidhana is
          an important item in his Kriya-Yoga and Niyama.

          Egoism, ambition and Vasanas are obstacles in the way of
          self-surrender. Subtle hidden Vasanas will try to come to the surface
          of the mind. Desires, which are suppressed for some time, will again
          manifest with redoubled force, if the aspirant is not careful, if
          there is some waning in his Vairagya and spiritual practice, and if he
          mixes with worldly-minded people. Generally the aspirant consciously
          or unconsciously, wittingly or unwittingly keeps up some desires for
          his gratification. He does not wish to part completely with his
          desires. Therefore the self-surrender does not become perfect and
          unreserved. So the grace of the Lord does not descend. Even if there
          is an atom of desire or egoism, there is no possibility of Divine
          Grace. Mira says: "I have given up my mind, my heart, my soul, my
          Chitta, my intellect, my all to my beloved Giridhar Gopal. " This is
          complete self-surrender. Mark the word 'my all'. The Lord becomes a
          slave of a Bhakta only when he has made absolute, ungrudging,
          self-surrender. He is very cruel and puts His devotee to severe tests
          and trials. Only when Surdas poked his eyes with the thorns and
          remained without food and water in the thick jungle, Lord Krishna
          appeared before him with sweetmeats and water. He did not hear the
          words of Draupadi, so long as she kept up her own strength and traces
          of egoism. When she cried aloud with perfect sincerity and total
          resignation: "O Dwarakanath, O my beloved! Come to my rescue. " Then
          He ran to the scene, she had abundant clothes, and her modesty was
          saved. Nyasa means renunciation. This brings Nirodha (control) of
          mind. It is renunciation of the fruits of works. Renunciation of
          egoism is Sarva-Tyaga (renunciation of all). All desires, selfishness,
          Raga, Dvesha, body-idea, Deha-abhimana, are hanging on egoism. Egoism
          is the pivot on which all these are centred. Kill egoism. Then the
          surrender becomes complete. Even if there is a tinge or grain of
          egoism, the Lord will not reveal Himself.

        </div>
        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          "Ananyata" is single-minded devotion unto the Lord. The child thinks
          of the mother and mother alone. A passionate husband thinks of his
          wife and wife alone. A greedy money-lender thinks of his money and
          money alone. Even so the devotee should entertain in his heart the
          picture of his Ishtam and Ishtam alone. Then he can have Darshan of
          God easily. Lord Krishna says to Arjuna: "I am easily attainable by
          that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me (for a
          long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single mind or
          one-pointed mind), O Partha! " (Gita: VIII-14. )
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The single-minded devotion can only manifest by constant and
          protracted practice in a quiet room, and Vairagya. Whenever the
          wavering and unsteady mind runs out, curb it, draw it and fix it again
          and again at the face or lotus feet of the Lord. It takes some time
          for the collection of scattered rays of the mind, and for establishing
          new habits in the mind. One should not be discouraged in the
          beginning. Patience, perseverance, attention, faith, strong will,
          fortitude, power of endurance are needed. These virtues should be
          cultivated. Satsanga, dietetic adjustment, milk and fruits, fasting,
          control of sleep, reduction in the hours of sleep, sometimes
          seclusion, observance of Mauna, Brahmacharya should be resorted to.
          The mind is naturally prone to love of ease, gluttony, laziness,
          seeking of comforts, gossiping, worldly talks, sight seeing etc. It
          should be gradually trained, tamed and disciplined by suitable
          methods. It is like a spoiled, indulgent child. It must be sometimes
          coaxed, while at other times, if it is unruly and disobedient, it must
          be threatened and whipped. Fasting is whipping. Mauna is whipping.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Udaseenata is indifference to sensual enjoyments and sensual objects.
          Objects are enemies of God. Sons, wife, property, cattle, house,
          friends, relatives are the enemies of God. You must cherish perfect
          indifference to these objects. You must destroy ruthlessly Moha for
          these objects and develop the state of Nirabhimanata (without
          'mine-ness'). Moha is infatuated love towards body, children, father,
          mother and wife. Attachment to the body is deep-rooted. You must not
          think of the body and its wants too much. Thoughts of body, thoughts
          of food, thoughts of wife and children make you forget God. You cannot
          have thoughts of God if you have thoughts of Anatma things
          (non-sentient objects).
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          There is supreme joy and bliss in Udaseenata. You will find in the
          Mundaka Upanishad: "Two birds, inseparable companions, dwell upon one
          and the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit; the other looks
          on without eating. On the same tree, the Jiva immersed in worldliness
          and bewildered grieves on account of helplessness. But when he sees
          the other, the Lord, who is adored by all, and His glory, then his
          grief passes away. " Here one bird is the Jiva, the other bird is the
          Lord. The tree is this body. Udaseenata destroys all sorts of
          attachments and desires. Attachment is death. Udaseenata is eternal
          life. Lord Krishna says: "An Udaseena (indifferent man) is dear to Me.
          " (Gita: XII-16. ) Just as the spectators of a cricket or football
          match enjoy the game nicely, so also an Udaseena who is quite
          unconcerned with the world enjoys as a witness of this world-drama and
          passes beyond grief. In the Gita (XIII-9) you will find:
          "Unattachment, absence of self-identification with son, wife or home
          and constant balance of mind in wished for and unwished for
          events-this is declared to be the Wisdom. "
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Remember, dear readers! that Udaseenata is not physical nudity. It is
          not the living on Neem leaves or cow's dung or groundnut. Performance
          of foolish kinds of austerities (Moodha Tapas) does not constitute
          Udaseenata. Lord Krishna says (Gita: XVII-5, 6): "Those men who
          practise terrific austerities not enjoined by the scriptures, given to
          hypocrisy and egoism, impelled by the force of lust and attachment,
          senseless, torturing all the elements in the body and Me also, Who
          dwell in the body, -know thou these to be of demoniacal resolves. "
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Udaseenata is purely a mental state. Queen Chudala was a perfect
          Udaseena though she reigned over a dominion; but her husband was
          attached to his begging bowl and walking-stick though he lived in a
          forest. A man may be attached to his Kowpeen or a fountain-pen even,
          whereas a king like Janaka may be a perfect Udaseena though he is
          amidst luxuries and opulence. Worldly people attach much importance to
          external show only. This is a great pity. This is their horrible
          mistake. A man may be nude and yet his mind may be full of desires.
          Some hypocrites pretend to be Virakta Sadhus to exploit the
          householders. Householders should use their discrimination always.
          Udaseena Vritti comes from Mithya Drishti and Dosha Drishti in objects
          and from discrimination between the real and the unreal.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Here is a definition of Ananyata-mind is clinging to persons, objects
          or places with leechlike tenacity. Wherever there is a little sensual
          pleasure, the mind is attached there, through Raga. All the
          pleasure-centres should be destroyed. Then alone the mind can be
          turned towards God with one-pointed concentration. The mind is always
          jumping like a monkey. Now it thinks of sweetmeats or fruits. Then it
          thinks of cinema-show for feasting the eyes. Then it wants to hear
          some melodious music. Then it wants to talk something with some
          friends. Just as a Chinaman is drawn hither and thither by his five
          wives, so also the mind is tossed hither and thither by the five
          Indriyas. It is always restless.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Through Vairagya and discrimination all these pleasure- centres should
          be destroyed. Then through constant, steady Abhyasa of Japa and
          Dhyana, it should be turned towards God. The struggle is doubtless,
          keen and hard. How difficult it will be to send up the waters of the
          Ganga above towards Badri Narayan! Still more difficult it will be for
          taking the mental energy towards God. It is easy to direct the mental
          energy towards sensual objects. It is but natural. It is the nature of
          the mind to run by itself towards objects without the least exertion.
          It is its Svabhava. Lord Krishna says: "With the mind not moving
          towards any other thing, made steadfast by the method of habitual
          meditation, and constantly meditating, one goes to the Supreme Person,
          the Resplendent, O Partha. " (Gita: VIII-8. ) "Fix thy mind on Me
          only, thy intellect in Me, (then) thou shalt no doubt live in Me alone
          hereafter. If thou art unable to fix thy mind steadily on Me, then by
          the Yoga of constant practice (Abhyasa Yoga) do thou seek to reach Me,
          O Dhananjaya. " (Gita: XII-8, 9. ) In the practice of concentration
          one should have the same patience and perseverance as that of the bird
          which tried to empty the ocean with its beak or blade of grass. Arjuna
          aimed at the bird above by seeing the reflection of the bird in the
          water. The arrow-maker was so much absorbed in his work that he did
          not notice the huge crowd of the Raja and his retinue. Such must be
          the nature of concentration on God in the Adhyatmic battlefield. Just
          as the bird that is tied to a post flutters about hither and thither
          and eventually rests on the post, so also the mind that wanders about
          here and there in sensual objects finally rests in God, through the
          practice of one-pointed concentration and devotion.

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Lord Krishna says: "If also thou art not equal to constant practice,
          be intent on My service; performing actions for My sake, thou shalt
          attain perfection. " (XII-10. ) "Acts of sacrifice, gift and charity
          should not be relinquished, but should be performed; sacrifice, gift,
          and also austerity are the purifiers of the intelligence. " (XVIII-5.
          )
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          These rituals purify the heart and prepare the ground of Antahkarana
          for the growth of devotion. These actions should be performed without
          attachment and without expectation of fruit. The sacrifice which is
          offered by men without desire for fruit as enjoined by the ordinances,
          under the firm belief that sacrifice is a duty, that is pure. The
          three kinds of austerity viz. , physical, verbal, and mental Tapas
          prescribed in the Seventeenth Chapter of the Gita purify the heart
          rapidly. They are:
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          1. <strong>Physical</strong>: Worship given to the gods, to the
          twice-born, to the teachers and to the wise, purity,
          straight-forwardness, continence and harmlessness, are called the
          austerity of the body.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          2. <strong>Verbal</strong>: Speech causing no annoyance, truthful and
          beneficial, the practice of the study of the scriptures are called the
          austerity of speech.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          3. <strong>Mental</strong>: Mental happiness, equilibrium, silence,
          self-control, purity of nature, this is called the austerity of the
          mind.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          This threefold austerity, performed by men with the utmost faith,
          without desire for fruit, harmonised, is said to be pure.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Without purification of the mind, there is no hope of cultivating
          Bhakti in the heart.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Agnihotra, Vaisvadeva, Brahma Yajna, Sandhyavandana in the three
          periods of time, Pancha Maha Yajnas-all are best calculated to purify
          the Chitta. They should be performed daily without any break.
          Observance of Chandrayana Vrata and Krichhra Vrata destroy sins
          effectively. They serve the purpose of Prayaschitta for expiating sin.
          The more the mind-mirror is cleansed, the better it is. Though these
          ceremonies are not necessary for an advanced Bhakta, yet they are very
          essential for neophytes.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Sraddha, Tarpan, observances and gifts on the occasion of eclipses
          should not be neglected. Consult the code of Manu or Yajnavalkya
          Smriti and you will get abundant information on this subject. Various
          kinds of Prayaschitta destroy various kinds of sin. If you find it
          difficult to consult the scriptures, consult Pundits and Acharyas and
          they will guide you. If you do not observe these rituals, you will be
          subject to Pratyavaya Dosha, the sin of omission. Jaimini lays great
          stress on Karmas (Agnihotra etc. )
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Pradosha Vrata, Ekadasi Vrata are observances that propitiate Lord
          Siva and Lord Hari respectively. They should also be observed rigidly.

        <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          That is the reason why Lord Krishna says: "The ignorant, the
          faithless, the doubting self goes to destruction; there is neither
          this world nor the other, nor happiness for the doubting self. "
          (Gita: IV-40. ) "Therefore, let the scriptures be the authority in
          determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done.
          Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou
          shouldst act here in this world. " (Gita: XVI-24. )
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The mind should not be allowed to have its own ways. He who follows
          the injunctions of the Sastras will evolve quickly. He will have no
          uneasiness in mind. He will have satisfaction. He will feel that he is
          in the right path and progressing rapidly in spirituality. He will
          feel the nearness of God. He will have peace of mind.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Scriptures are infallible. Vedas have come out from the mouth of God.
          They are revelations. They are traditionally handed down from Rishis
          and seers to their disciples in succession (Parampara). So long as
          there is world, there are scriptures and teachers to guide the people
          in the path of Truth and Righteousness. The number of teachers may be
          few in the iron age but they do exist. Books are not eternal. But the
          ideas in the Vedas are eternal.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          It does not require much wisdom and reasoning to have a firm
          conviction in the existence of God. I do not know why these
          rationalists, socialists and materialistic scientists are
          unnecessarily racking their brains, fighting and doubting. It is
          really a great pity! It is their stiff egoism that makes them deny the
          existence of God. Whether they accept His existence or not, He is
          shining from eternity to eternity. The sun is always there whether the
          owls accept the existence of the sun or not. There are gross
          impurities in their minds which screen and cloud their understanding.
          There are sins in their Antahkarana which make their intellects
          perverted. They will have to wait for some time for grasping the
          Truth.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Just as a young plant is fenced in the beginning and protected, so
          also a neophyte in the path of devotion should be well-protected. If
          he mixes with atheists, he will lose his faith in God quickly. He must
          be always in the company of Sadhus, Mahatmas and Bhaktas. Their
          company is an iron fortress for him. If the injunctions of the Sastras
          are rigidly followed, nothing can shake one's convictions. Just as a
          nail is driven deep into a plank by frequent hammerings, so also the
          Samskaras and convictions become very deep by observing strictly the
          sacred laws of the scriptures. This is the meaning of this Sutra.
