      <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

      <p class="lesson-text">
        Atha means now. It is something used in the sense of sequence. It is a
        word that is used when a subject is begun, to invoke the Divine
        blessing. Sutra means an aphorism or terse saying impregnated with
        deep significance. Just as flowers and pearls are arranged or studded
        on a thread, so also philosophical ideas are studded or spread or
        arranged in the aphorism. Rishis always have expressed their ideas in
        the form of laconic Sutras. That is the beauty in the writings of
        Rishis or seers. That is the sign of God-realisation. The six Darsanas
        or schools of philosophy are embodied in the form of Sutras only.
        Without a commentary it is difficult for laymen to understand these
        Sutras.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Bhakti is defined in the following Sutra. Those who have understood
        the magnitude of human sufferings in this sense-universe and those who
        have realised that this world is unreal, impermanent, illusory,
        perishable, full of troubles, difficulties, miseries, pain, sorrow and
        tribulation and those who desire to free themselves from the round of
        births and deaths with its concomitant evils of old age, diseases,
        etc. , should know what Bhakti is, how to develop Bhakti, who is God
        or Lord or Isvara, the relationship between God and man and the
        methods to realise God, or to approach Him or to attain
        God-Consciousness.

      <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The term Bhakti comes from the root "Bhaj", which means "to be
        attached to God. " Bhajan, worship, Bhakti, Anurag, Prem, Priti are
        synonymous terms. Bhakti is love for love's sake. The devotee wants
        God and God alone. There is no selfish expectation here. There is no
        fear also. Therefore it is called "Parama-prema-rupaa. " Is the son
        afraid of his father, who is a Sessions Judge? Is the wife afraid of
        her husband? So also a devotee entertains not the least fear of God.
        The fear of retribution vanishes in him. He feels, believes, conceives
        and imagines that his Ishtam is an Ocean of Love or Prem.

        God, Immortality (Amritam), peace (Santi), Absolute, Infinite
        (Ananda), Intelligence, Consciousness (Chit), Eternity, Bliss
        (Ananda), Nirvana, Freedom (Mukti), Perfection (Siddhi), are
        synonymous terms.

      <p class="lesson-text">
        Devotion gives Immortality. Bhakti is an embodiment of Amritam or
        nectar. Nitya Sukha (eternal bliss), Immortality, Parama Santi
        (supreme peace), Nitya Tripti (eternal satisfaction), Akhanda Sukha
        (unbroken joy) can be had only in God. That is the reason why
        aspirants attempt for God-realisation. Worldly pleasure is not
        constant. He who smiles and laughs for five minutes weeps bitterly for
        hours together. No man in this world is perfectly happy. A
        multimillionaire is full of cares, worries, anxieties and fear. He is
        afraid of enemies. He is guarded by sepoys. He has to take injections
        for getting sleep, as he is always worried. He is worse than a
        prisoner. Rockefeller, the richest man in the world, who could pave a
        road of several miles with golden sheets expressed to a priest who
        went to behold his glory and opulence: "O reverend priest! I am the
        most miserable man in the world. I can't eat anything; my stomach,
        kidneys and liver are filled with germs and diseases. I am always
        restless". Maitreyi puts a question to her husband: "O my Lord! Can
        the wealth of the three worlds give me immortality?" Yajnavalkya
        replied: "Certainly not, my beloved. " Yama also says to Nachiketas:
        "Wealthy people, on account of delusion and pride, lose their memory,
        intellect and understanding, and go round and round in this
        impermanent and unhappy world and come again and again in my clutches.
        Wealth and woman are my two snares to entrap the worldly-minded
        persons whose minds are filled with lust and greed. You are above
        these things. You have shunned all my temptations. You have selected
        the Sreyo-Marga".
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        This is a world of diversity. Intellects are different. Faces are
        different. Religions are different. Sounds are different. Faiths are
        different. Colours are different. Faculties are different. Tastes and
        temperaments are different. But one thing is common in all. Every one
        of us wants Nitya Sukha (eternal happiness), infinite Knowledge,
        Immortality, freedom and independence. These things can be obtained by
        God-realisation alone.
