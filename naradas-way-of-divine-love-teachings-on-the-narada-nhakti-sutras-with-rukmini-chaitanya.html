      <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

      <p class="lesson-text">
        Atha means now. It is something used in the sense of sequence. It is a
        word that is used when a subject is begun, to invoke the Divine
        blessing. Sutra means an aphorism or terse saying impregnated with
        deep significance. Just as flowers and pearls are arranged or studded
        on a thread, so also philosophical ideas are studded or spread or
        arranged in the aphorism. Rishis always have expressed their ideas in
        the form of laconic Sutras. That is the beauty in the writings of
        Rishis or seers. That is the sign of God-realisation. The six Darsanas
        or schools of philosophy are embodied in the form of Sutras only.
        Without a commentary it is difficult for laymen to understand these
        Sutras.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        Bhakti is defined in the following Sutra. Those who have understood
        the magnitude of human sufferings in this sense-universe and those who
        have realised that this world is unreal, impermanent, illusory,
        perishable, full of troubles, difficulties, miseries, pain, sorrow and
        tribulation and those who desire to free themselves from the round of
        births and deaths with its concomitant evils of old age, diseases,
        etc. , should know what Bhakti is, how to develop Bhakti, who is God
        or Lord or Isvara, the relationship between God and man and the
        methods to realise God, or to approach Him or to attain
        God-Consciousness.

      <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The term Bhakti comes from the root "Bhaj", which means "to be
        attached to God. " Bhajan, worship, Bhakti, Anurag, Prem, Priti are
        synonymous terms. Bhakti is love for love's sake. The devotee wants
        God and God alone. There is no selfish expectation here. There is no
        fear also. Therefore it is called "Parama-prema-rupaa. " Is the son
        afraid of his father, who is a Sessions Judge? Is the wife afraid of
        her husband? So also a devotee entertains not the least fear of God.
        The fear of retribution vanishes in him. He feels, believes, conceives
        and imagines that his Ishtam is an Ocean of Love or Prem.

        Devotion gives Immortality. Bhakti is an embodiment of Amritam or
        nectar. Nitya Sukha (eternal bliss), Immortality, Parama Santi
        (supreme peace), Nitya Tripti (eternal satisfaction), Akhanda Sukha
        (unbroken joy) can be had only in God. That is the reason why
        aspirants attempt for God-realisation. Worldly pleasure is not
        constant. He who smiles and laughs for five minutes weeps bitterly for
        hours together. No man in this world is perfectly happy. A
        multimillionaire is full of cares, worries, anxieties and fear. He is
        afraid of enemies. He is guarded by sepoys. He has to take injections
        for getting sleep, as he is always worried. He is worse than a
        prisoner. Rockefeller, the richest man in the world, who could pave a
        road of several miles with golden sheets expressed to a priest who
        went to behold his glory and opulence: "O reverend priest! I am the
        most miserable man in the world. I can't eat anything; my stomach,
        kidneys and liver are filled with germs and diseases. I am always
        restless". Maitreyi puts a question to her husband: "O my Lord! Can
        the wealth of the three worlds give me immortality?" Yajnavalkya
        replied: "Certainly not, my beloved. " Yama also says to Nachiketas:
        "Wealthy people, on account of delusion and pride, lose their memory,
        intellect and understanding, and go round and round in this
        impermanent and unhappy world and come again and again in my clutches.
        Wealth and woman are my two snares to entrap the worldly-minded
        persons whose minds are filled with lust and greed. You are above
        these things. You have shunned all my temptations. You have selected
        the Sreyo-Marga".
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        This is a world of diversity. Intellects are different. Faces are
        different. Religions are different. Sounds are different. Faiths are
        different. Colours are different. Faculties are different. Tastes and
        temperaments are different. But one thing is common in all. Every one
        of us wants Nitya Sukha (eternal happiness), infinite Knowledge,
        Immortality, freedom and independence. These things can be obtained by
        God-realisation alone.

      <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        These are the fruits of Bhakti. Sutras 4, 5 and 6 describe the fruits
        of Bhakti. All weaknesses and Doshas (faults) vanish. People put a
        question: "How can we love God whom we have not seen?" Remain in the
        company of Bhaktas; hear the Lilas of Bhagavan, His Aisvaryas (Divine
        powers) or Vibhutis, His Madhurya (grace and beauty); serve Bhaktas;
        sing His Name daily and do Japa of His Mantra; stay for one year in
        Ayodhya, Vrindavana, Chitrakuta, Rishikesh or Pandharpur. You will
        develop love for God.

      </h4>
      <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

      <p class="lesson-text">
        Why does desire manifest? On account of Avidya or ignorance or
        imperfection or lack of bliss. When one gets Darshan of God, all
        desires are burnt up. When the boy Dhruva had Darshan of Lord Hari,
        the desire to obtain kingdom that prompted him to worship,
        disappeared. Devotion is a fire like Jnanagni (fire of wisdom) that
        burns up all mundane desires.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        How can a trace of earthly desire remain when the devotee attains God,
        the embodiment of bliss? Darshan of God comes in various ways viz. ,
        in dreams, in physical form with four hands, with conch, mace, discus
        and lotus-flower in the hands, in the form of cosmic consciousness
        (Visvarupa Darshan) which Arjuna had, in the form of Hiranyagarbha
        consciousness or full knowledge of Brahma- loka, etc. Note how Arjuna
        expresses his experiences of cosmic consciousness: "Nor source, nor
        midst, nor end; infinite force, unnumbered arms, the sun and moon
        Thine eyes; I see Thy face, as sacrificial fire, blazing, its
        splendour burneth up the worlds. " God sometimes gives Darshan to
        encourage His devotees by coming down in Vimana (or celestial car).
        Akasa Vani, dazzling lights in space or sky are some other
        encouragements which God gives to push His devotees on the path
        vigorously and rapidly. The devotee should not stop his Sadhana on
        account of false Tushti (satisfaction) when he gets His Darshan. He
        should ever rest in God. He should have perfect Nishtha in God always
        (Svaroopa-sthiti). He should not leave off his practices till he
        merges himself in the Lord-Maha-Bhava or Tanmaya State (Parama Prem).
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        The devotee who realises God is freed from grief also. Can darkness
        remain in the presence of light? How can sorrow manifest when one is
        immersed in the Ocean of Bliss and Prem? Grief is a mental creation.
        It manifests when the mind is attached to body and illusory
        connections. When the mind is obliterated, when there is
        Self-absorption and self-effacement by merging in the bosom of God,
        how can grief approach the devotee? Absolutely impossible. The devotee
        does not hate anything. Hatred is due to ignorance. How can the
        devotee hate anybody when he sees Lord Hari in everything? He feels
        that the world is manifestation of the Lord and all movements and
        actions are His Lilas. He has no Ghrina or dislike for faecal matter,
        dirt, Chandala, scavenger, cobbler, beggar, prostitute, thief, etc. He
        says: "I see everywhere my sweet Lord. It is Hari who is playing the
        part of prostitute, thief, dacoit, scavenger". He has an
        all-embracing, all-inclusive, exalted mental state. This cannot be
        adequately described in words. It has to be felt. Mira, Gouranga,
        Hafiz, Tulasi Das, Kabir, Ram Das all enjoyed this state. Tulasi Das
        says: "Shiyaram maya sab jaga jane, karahu pranam jory juge pani-Know
        everything as Siyaram, Sita and Rama, and with folded hands do
        prostrations to all, to everything. "

        In Purusha Sukta you will find a description of the Purusha: "The
        Purusha has one thousand heads, one thousand eyes, one thousand feet.
        " There is an echo of these ideas in the Gita (XIII-13): "With hands
        and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears
        everywhere, He exists in the worlds enveloping all". Lord Krishna
        gives advice to Uddhava and prescribes an easy way for reaching Him.
        "Know, Uddhava, that Brahmin, Chandala, ass, dog, king, beggar are all
        My forms. When you meet any object, do prostration and feel My
        presence". Nama Dev said to the dog: "O Vittala, my dear in the form
        of dog, do not run away with the dry bread. It will affect your soft
        throat. Pray, let me apply ghee to the bread". He ran with ghee in a
        cup to the dog. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa prostrated before an
        outcaste girl: "O Mother Kaali! I see Thee in this girl. " Pavhari
        Baba prostrated before a thief with a bag of utensils: "O thief
        Narayan! Pray, accept these things, I never knew that thief Narayan
        was in my cottage". Ekanath, a Maharashtra Bhakta gave his ring
        voluntarily to a thief when he entered the house: "O thief! Take this
        ring also. Your kartavya (duty) is to steal the things. Thou art
        Vittala (Krishna). Keep up this Lila. " Have you understood the
        sublime state of these exalted Bhaktas who have a new angle of vision?
        A day will come to you also. Exert. Struggle. Pray. Worship. Meditate.
        Plunge yourself in Bhajan with zeal, earnestness and fervour.

        Give up this unquenchable thirst for sensual pleasure, woman, money
        and worldly prosperity which is the greatest obstacle in the path of
        devotion and turn your mind towards God. Here is an inexhaustible and
        imperishable spiritual wealth which no dacoit can rob and a Divine
        Bliss which is not mixed with fear or pain.

      <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

      <p class="lesson-text">
        When one is happy in his own Self, then alone he becomes independent.
        If one depends for his happiness on perishable objects, he begins to
        weep when the centre of his pleasure is withdrawn. The husband weeps
        when his wife or son dies, when the bank in which he has deposited his
        money fails. Objects that are conditioned in time, space and causation
        are vinasi, perishable. They cannot give, therefore, eternal happiness
        to human beings. So in the Gita, Bhagavan Sri Krishna says: "The
        enjoyments that are born of contacts are only generators of pain, for
        they have a beginning and an end, O Kaunteya! The wise man does not
        rejoice in them. " (Gita: V-22. ) " That happiness which arises from
        the contact of the sense-organs with the objects, which is at first
        like nectar, and in the end like poison-Agre amritopamam pariname
        vishamiva" (Gita: XVIII-38. ) "With the self unattached to external
        contacts he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in the
        meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness. " (Gita:
        V-21. ) "The man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with
        the Self and who is content in the Self alone, for him verily there is
        nothing to do. " (Gita: III-17. ) Nothing can shake a man who rejoices
        in the Self (Atmarati); who is satisfied in the Self (Atma Tripti);
        and who is contented in the Self (Atma Santoshi); and who plays in the
        Self (Atma Kreeda).
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        It is Vasana (subtle desire) that draws a man outside towards external
        objects. Avidya (ignorance) has got two forces, the Avarana or veiling
        power, the Sakti that screens the man from his real Sat-chit-ananda
        Svaroopa behind, and the Vikshepa Sakti that makes the mind and senses
        outgoing. The restlessness of the mind is due to desire and Vikshepa
        Sakti. Avidya clouds the understanding and produces intoxication,
        destroys the intellect and makes the intellect perverted, stony and
        barren. Therefore man always thinks that he can get pleasure in
        external objects, mistakes the body, children and wife as Atman and
        takes the unreal world as real. When lust manifests, the intellect
        becomes blind and the most intelligent man becomes an easy prey to
        passion. A worldly-minded man vainly searches for his happiness in
        outside perishable objects. The idea that he should dive deep into the
        chambers of his heart by collecting all the dissipated rays of the
        mind, and by withdrawing the out-going senses to meditate on God never
        strikes him. He never believes in devotion, concentration and
        meditation. He cannot imagine a pure, unalloyed happiness that is
        independent of external objects, although he enjoys the bliss of the
        Self daily at night. He foolishly thinks: "If I have a bungalow in
        Mussoorie for summer, if I have a car, if I have my own cow for good
        milk, if I have a son, if I have a garden, I will be happy. " The
        tendency of the mind is such that it tries to seek happiness outside
        in perishable objects. This is due to the force of Avidya.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">
        But the devotee gets the grace of the Lord. His intellect is calm and
        tranquil. All the outgoing energies become transmuted into spiritual
        energy. He gets help and strength from Mantra-Sakti, Sadhana Sakti and
        Upasana Sakti. Sattva flows from the feet of the Lord towards his
        mind. All desires melt away. The Vikshepa Sakti is destroyed. He has
        the firm, unshakable conviction that the real happiness is in God. His
        mind is always inward. He has Antarmukha Vritti. The senses do not
        wander about. They get absorbed in the mind and the mind gets absorbed
        in God. He is ever peaceful. He enjoys the happiness within. He
        delights in the bliss of God. He therefore stands adamantine even
        amidst grave troubles and calamities. So Rishi Narada uses the
        expressions "Stabdho bhavati" (the devotee becomes serene) and
        "Atmaramo bhavati" (happy in the bliss of the Self).

        The devotee gets divine intoxication. Lord Gouranga was so much
        intoxicated with the divine nectar of Prem that sometimes he did not
        know when it was daybreak and when it was night. Mira, though a young
        Rani, danced in the streets amidst males and men of inferior class on
        account of this intoxication of Krishna-prem. Sri Ramakrishna
        Paramahamsa remained in the thick jungle for four days without taking
        any food when he was under this divine intoxication. Words can hardly
        describe the nature of this divine intoxication. One has to feel it
        himself. Even if there is a mild intoxication, it will give immense
        strength to the devotee to face the difficulties in the battle of
        life. Therefore Narada says: "matto bhavati. "
