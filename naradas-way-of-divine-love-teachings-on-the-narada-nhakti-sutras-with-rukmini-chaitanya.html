      <h3>Notes and Commentary</h3>

      <p class="lesson-text">Atha means now. It is something used in the sense of sequence. It is a word that is used
        when a subject is begun, to invoke the Divine blessing. Sutra means an aphorism or terse saying impregnated with
        deep significance. Just as flowers and pearls are arranged or studded on a thread, so also philosophical ideas
        are studded or spread or arranged in the aphorism. Rishis always have expressed their ideas in the form of
        laconic Sutras. That is the beauty in the writings of Rishis or seers. That is the sign of God-realisation. The
        six Darsanas or schools of philosophy are embodied in the form of Sutras only. Without a commentary it is
        difficult for laymen to understand these Sutras.
      </p>
      <p class="lesson-text">Bhakti is defined in the following Sutra. Those who have understood the magnitude of human
        sufferings in this sense-universe and those who have realised that this world is unreal, impermanent, illusory,
        perishable, full of troubles, difficulties, miseries, pain, sorrow and tribulation and those who desire to free
        themselves from the round of births and deaths with its concomitant evils of old age, diseases, etc. , should
        know what Bhakti is, how to develop Bhakti, who is God or Lord or Isvara, the relationship between God and man
        and the methods to realise God, or to approach Him or to attain God-Consciousness.</p>
